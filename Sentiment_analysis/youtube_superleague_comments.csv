MsGangster107,2023-12-23T08:29:48Z,0,"The biggest crap is when clubs start a super league... In the third case, some club will steal a large amount of money. You know what I want to tell you (stealing money for your own interests) Clubs should compete and not deal with other things. Here nui more in the game just the game as such. The Super League is the brainchild of certain lobbies who want to get rich. The game of football itself will no longer make sense."
bobsmith3291,2023-11-25T03:19:18Z,0,The cheek of Man City and rotor ham to think they’re big clubs 😂

rednaskela4830,2023-06-20T12:10:44Z,0,"The ignorant American owners infuriates me more than the corrupt Agnelli and Perez for some reason. In which universe did they expect a press release like this to be welcomed by the world of football or their own fans for that matter. I could see a UCL replacement for a worldwide tournament at some point, that would be equally as lucrative with more than doubling the revenue of todays UCL and allow clubs outside of Europe to compete on the same level. That is the opposite of what the Super League tried to do and would benefit football as a whole..."
ymg8057,2022-12-07T18:27:24Z,0,"When does it start? I thought it was supposed to be starting in 2022, but there are only three and a half weeks left of the year, so I assume it's going to start very soon! I would have thought they wouldn't have held it when the World Cup's on. So, I assume then that it'll start after its Final on 18th December then! _ _ _ _ What's that? _ _ _ It's been cancelled? Did I blink and miss something? I was wondering why I hadn't heard about it for a while! One minute it was all over the media and next moment I wasn't hearing anything about it anymore! I must have blinked, and it was cancelled whilst I was blinking, or something! Oh, I was SO looking forward to watching all those plastic clubs playing each other endlessly and repetitively in their elitist private members club! Who doesn't want to watch Barca and Real play each other again and again and again endlessly in ""El Plastico"", or whatever it is called?"

Doesn't feel good when its happening to you does it? Karma coming back to haunt them. I personally don't care whether the teams stay or go, but I'm enjoying watching Sky, UEFA and FIFA getting a taste of their own medicine.

And players will be less worn out from the extra matches too. Big Players who have “won it all” such as Ronaldo and Messi have new motivation as well and will be motivated to stay on with their respective clubs. Ofc this super league should have its own “relegation system” such that only the top 20 teams in the world qualify every 3 years. (Or a qualifying metric based on past 3 years performance in the champions league). Win for clubs, win for fans."

The point is what is better for us fans, national leagues and eufa league based on that or an united Europe-wide league.
Europe-wide league is good for more regular competion of good clubs. But the danger come from Founding members and their bosses can hold too much power. And this kind of ""globalization"" in football will kill small clubs with very hard competition."

andrewockenden,2021-04-19T22:54:39Z,0,"It is many years since football ceased to be a sport and became an industry. I wonder why the Banks don't call in the overdrafts of the clubs involved in this latest racket, as well as all the overdrafts of all the players who play for them, and put a time limit by which the overdrafts must be cleared. Fight  fire with fire. The proposed 'Super League' would soon loose all its appeal, when the clubs are forced  out of becoming prima donnas, like many of their vastly overpaid players. This would be further hastened by ALL spectators and club 'members' , revoking their memberships and ceasing to pay club 'dues'. No income forces closure. Football could become a real sport again, instead of being the money printing machine it has become. My tip, if you love football, watch local non-league teams and encourage their players."

ah-sc7rw,2021-04-19T17:03:35Z,1,"Ladz, this ain’t no conspiracy theory. Hear me out. These 12 clubs have created this super league as a leverage in negotiations with their respective local league. You see, a couple of years back, the big teams that dominated their local leagues made quite a large percentage of their league’s TV rights. This was based on the popularity of each match being watched on TV. This led to a wider ‘club worth’ gap between clubs in the same league and results like Barcelona 7-1. And these big clubs basically dominated. But recently, the leagues have caught up on this and begun distributing the money almost evenly to the clubs in the league. Which is giving less popular clubs more money and so better transfers, and resources. So the big clubs are not happy about this, because A they aren’t getting as much % money as they used to and B, because these less popular teams are now better equipped and put up tougher games against the big clubs. Therefore, the big clubs have created this super league as a negotiating tool to allow for greater percentage profits from their respective leagues. I honestly think that this super league won’t happen as the repercussions on the clubs is too big, but it will help them secure a bigger share of the TV rights $ in their league."

Bad for football? Hipocrisy at its best.
This the best thing can happen to the beautiful game! The current governing bodies are simply scared cause they can't have their ways anymore, this change may or may not be good at first but could open the door to a better way to regulate football for the better. 
Many fans don't look beyond a seat at the stadiums or watching a game from home, they have no clue how corrupt these organizations are and have been doing through the years.

It's not going to be easy, and I understand how fandom works so the idea of supporting a different club is blasphemous, but at the end of the day this is as much about the existence of fair competition and the sport itself as it is bleeding your team colors.

Its very clear this change is threatening the relevance of the premier league and other bodies in football hence the objection.

I speak on behalf of many football fans around the world, Man utd vs RM, Barca Vs Chelsea, Juventus Vs Liverpool, Arsenal Vs AC Milan, these are mouth-watering fixtures any fan would love to see every week. If you are a fan of a small club, am sorry but go and compete with teams at your level. The European super league is for the big clubs and is a brilliant idea. I support."
lennynoronha8940,2021-04-19T09:18:14Z,0,forget what the clubs think about this because we know they are only bothered about the money. but what is the players take on this? do they like the idea of not playing for their national teams?

Skyhighatrist90,2021-04-19T08:24:34Z,0,The champions league as its name states is not a league. The format of the ulc should change to an actual league. The idea that it’s closed and for only the founding clubs does worry me as it means other teams around the world lose out on being as big of a club as these 12 founding clubs. I personally feel they need to work with uefa and fifa on this. The champions league systems in my opinion has been stale for along time and needs updating. I just feel the champions league needs to change to an actual league where it’s mid week football and then home league games on the weekend like it is now. I do feel a bit worried that 6 of the 12 teams So far are from the PL and it’s a closed league there needs to still be some sort of entrance to this European super league that’s why I think the ulc needs to just join this idea and there still be a way for clubs to join this new league from some sort of promotion.

The players and managers need to come out and have their say and not be silenced by the people who employ them. I can imagine they have had fincial threats and more thrown towards them if they speak out about the club, absolute joke!"
barryholloway8565,2021-04-19T08:09:07Z,0,No problem if six leave  then upgrade via the league's tables remove them from all British sport and ignore all climbs from a British football and ban the club's from dealing with other clubs from the country and across the world the only way to deal with this is mass protests at all of the six stadiums by there own fans and true supporters cancel there season tickets and let them remain with empty stadiums across the world  life is more important than death  as a west ham  supporter this will make us top London club every year LOL

bkayfitness8827,2021-04-19T07:12:03Z,0,Tbf if the super league plays once every 2 weeks an teams still play in there natural league an super league replaces the champions league an the top six from pl changes an other teams have a chance to compete it could have potential as long as it comes to a logical agreement id like to play a team like psg or real Madrid more than once it be fun the fans can save up to book a holiday for a week go abroad but during that time get pissed in the pub while your team batters real Madrid get new players new money all for getting rid of the champions league it sounds like uefa dont want this to happen but a whole season to predict the best team in the world instead of a little tournament an it doesn't affect anything else beside money wise in their natural league witch tbh man city do every few years isnt so bad

I’m so glad I support my home town Rochdale AFC and not a premier league team. They are ruining football it’s it’s sad to see.
saucyisawesome,2021-04-19T06:53:50Z,0,I love it. This will make the league more fair since  all the league has been a no fair league in the first place. It’s always the team with the most money that never gets relegated anyways. If there was a salary cap then I’d believe all the hate that comes from it but since there’s no salary cap then I say go with the super league. It’s only fair. I always see the same teams with money in the top 10 over and over. I don’t blame super league. I blame all the leagues or fifa for not having salary cap. We always see all the attractive players in one team. Where’s the competition in that? If there was a salary cap then we’d see the likes of Mbappe to West Brom or some club and make that club more attractive to watch mostly because of him. Vote for Salary Cap. It will do good for all the leagues and clubs since it will have a trickle down effect. Which would make all team attractive to watch instead of the same big teams over and over.
daz0086,2021-04-19T06:52:10Z,0,"Agree with all the comments. This is the death of many teams not just in the lower leagues but also the premiership. What the so called top six have done is stab everyone in the back then kicked them in the face when they, we, are at our lowest. The premier league and other bodies need to stand up for the fans and those teams who stand with their fans. Let them go on the understanding they can’t play in their own league or cup competitions. If they change their minds they still need to be fined and deducted points for even threatening to do this. This is the time we need to stand tall and stand up to these bullies of the football world. Why should they dictate who is allowed what and who is the top six? They need punishments done now. Only then will the fans across the uk will feel we are in this together against such greed."

We will see what us as football fans are made off now, if this is really a serious move for the closed shop league. There will be deals done and us as fans will be hoodwinked. If ever there was a time to be together here it is folks. FIFFA, UEFA all corrupt and potentially this now. We just let them get away with it every time.

When they allowed owner like kroke and glazers to use the club like their sex toys to please themselves rather than fans. Where was there morality then? They are only mad now because they are not getting a peice of the cake. This abomination of esl is the hate child of fa lets not forget that.

michaelt9511,2021-04-19T05:55:02Z,0,"Tbh football is not really competitive  compared to American sports. In football it's always the same teams with the most money that win the league, with rare anomalies (Leicester, Wolfsburg, Deportivo La Coruna) over the last 20 years. The only way a small team can eventually win the league is if they get a multi-billionaire owner(s) who can provide the resources needed to win titles. There are also too many crap millionaire footballers. So a league with the best of the best footballers who actually deserve to be millionaires makes sense in this regard. If the Super League becomes a separate league there should be a draft system and salary cap system in place as well to ensure high level competition consistently. The world is changing, so the Super League will probably happen, traditional leagues will remain but won't be as exciting and will lose money big time. The only people that can stop it are top pro footballers if they boycott and decide not to play, but they won't."

A Leicester miracle could still happen just to win the league, and not like a Leicester could become a European regular and win it someday anyways, it will always be the royalties that compete in the last stages.

If EPL bans them they'll lose big TV money because no foreign TV rights is based on watching Aston Villa play Brighton.
They know there's a president of MLS players playing in FIFA competitions so FIFA doesn't have a legal standing to stop their players playing in FIFA tournaments.
UEFA preempted this announcement by appealing to emotions. Politicians that doesn't understand football is running and giving comments. 
The dispute is about Ceferin's idea of forcing these teams to play in expanded champions league where competitions is a lot weaker (not gonna sell on TV) hence less revenue. They're already doing thus playing in their domestic leagues.
UEFA is just too corrupt and maybe these teams are too greedy as well. But they generate the revenue and deserves more money and better competitions."

Everyone loves it when teams like Ajax and Porto make it to champions league semis as the underdogs. Also, the stuff about these clubs getting €3.5 billion is ridiculous. It will just create more of a monopoly amongst the best players, and then we wont see teams like leicester or west ham or atalanta becoming big european clubs as all this money will just give the big clubs even more money. I dont understand why everyone in this believes that they need even more money. Most big clubs still make hundreds of millions every year, what do these clubs expect? €1 billion spent every transfer window? Anyway, I'm gonna stop ranting now."

The problem is no one asked for this. While a lot of people surely are ""change = bad"" I don't think that's the case here. We want the league to be more competitive that every pl owner invests in their club and makes them better, which in turn makes the whole league better. This just increases the gap between the bigger teams and the smaller teams. So either you relegate all these teams from the pl or we get the same top 6 every year.

Interesting. Its as if the non-Italian owners of Italian teams don't care about Italian football, and sure don't give a damn about the cities themselves.

Arsenal, Chelsea, City, United, Liverpool, Tottenham (""English"" owner). Same deal. In Spain, the presidents are voted in by the greed of the shareholders. 
This isn't a sporting competition, its a racket, run like the American ""sporting"" franchises. To the fans of the teams involved, we've jokingly called you ""consumers"" instead of ""fans"" for years. If this goes through, I guess it won't be much of a joke anymore."

Justin-ml8id,2021-04-19T04:04:32Z,1,"I think this is a fantastic idea period. The biggest clubs in the world join to create a super competition that will be very exciting. They will make more money because they can. Big teams have always had great power already. Now, they just say damn you to uefa and make their own league to make money. The only downside I can think of is that the domestic leagues, apart from the championship race which usually just consists of two teams, wouldn't be as competitive as it is now due to no top 4, top 6 race or such anymore. Maybe, another con could be that we will not see surprises as we do in the ucl, i.e atalanta or port made it to the quarterfinal of the ucl.

I'm saying this as a fan of one of the big club in a foreign country so my perspective may be greedy and does not align with smaller teams' benefit but a league of elite clubs is absolutely brilliant."

UEFA and FIFA don't have to recognise the competition officially and surely they would lose far more by banning the teams than just continuing with their usual business.

timknott5856,2021-04-19T03:21:56Z,0,"Sorry this was inevitable and with the pandemic was  accelerated.

Uefa can try to claim “innocence” that they’re not involved. But they have been looking at this proposal for years and are very much involved...

the reality is as Football is the worlds most popular sport the CL should attract more revenues than the NFL and unfortunately they do not... looking at the ratings they have established that when the elite clubs play each other viewings go through the roof, however for the smaller games which we see during the group stages  it just doesn’t happen. 

The tipping point for clubs particularly the premiership clubs is the fact that the broadcasting revenue is not distributed in the same manner as it is in Spain where the likes of Liverpool who with the EPL and the CL within 2 seasons still cant compete with Barcelona and Madrid in the transfer market...

The reason being the premiership distributes the TV money in a way that basically mean the Big 4 are subsidizing the league.. domestically it is estimated the 80% of the uk fanatic and casual football fanbase support/ follow Utd, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham.. and it’s those who buy the subscriptions... this is even proven in the ratings where they go through the roof when these clubs play each other...with the global market Tottenham are replaced by Chelsea following their recent success and foreign imports during the mid to late 90s. What is frustrating the owners is that domestic revenue has 50% of the total value split evenly among the the 20 clubs before a ball is kicked. 25% is issued on league placement and the other 25% is issued based on appearances on the TV... The foreign broadcasting revenues 100% is distributed evenly amongst all 20 clubs...

This is not meritocracy as we keep hearing for those who oppose the super league.. this is football socialism where 16 clubs benefit from the global fan based of Utd, Liverpool and Arsenal who should be competing on budgets that eclipse Barcelona and Real Madrid..


This is made worse when the international broadcasting revenue for Laliga is distributed based on club buy outs meaning Barca and Real Madrid secure a substantial amount of revenues as a result..

To show how ridiculous it is - before the recent TV deal came in for the premiership which was the season Aston Villa got relegated. Their bottom placed finish secured earnings considerably more than Bayern Munich and PSG of whom competed in the CL and won all their domestic titles..

So again the arguments being held so regarding meritocracy ... how is it that a club finishing bottom and getting relegated can earn more prize money than clubs who win their respective league and Cup competitions? (With a global fan base I may add).. 

It’s like anything in life you don’t get the rewards you feel you deserve ... you’ll seek out an opportunity where you will get a better deal... this proposal was inevitable..."

GymStephen,2021-04-19T02:38:53Z,0,"A football league from which its founding members can never be relegated; the ultimate closed shop.

But these are currently the elite clubs of Europe and likely to remain so, able to attract the world's top players with vast salaries and a guaranteed promise of football every week against Europe's ultimate teams.

Threats of relegation, point deductions, loss of titles or a ban on players competing at international level all ring hollow. UEFA, FIFA and the Premier League are utterly impotent. These clubs' owners care nothing for history or titles, only money. The Premier League without the big six, a World Cup bereft of the very best, or Champions League devoid of the top clubs are all finished.

Capitalism at its worst and the ultimate example of what can happen when businessmen with zero interest in football are allowed free rein to purchase the world's top clubs."
ShaniAce,2021-04-19T02:38:34Z,0,"What bothers me more than this so-called super league is the hypocrisy in all the reactions to it. Football is commercialised down to the lower levels, everyone knows how corrupt FIFA, UEFA, the national FA's and the clubs are, and this super league is not really that different from UEFA's new Champions League proposal (which equally sucks because it also includes participation through merit rather than qualification through domestic competitions). Yet everyone's suddenly pretending like all the football clubs, national FA's UEFA etc are charitable organizations. They're not. They're all greedy and only interested in profit. Get a grip."

ProPlayPhocus,2021-04-19T02:34:55Z,1,Besides obviously money is a crucial factor. Do you think football would exist if it was not entertaining or profitable? Pep G said it perfectly: the best teams typically has the most money to attract the best players. Think about how great it would be to see purely great players competing aside from those who are not really that good. You cannot tell me all teams are created equally because teams become regulated for a reason. Some never to make it back to the champions league. Everyone needs to stop complaining and support football in general.

They know people tune into Europa only because man United and Arsenal are in it. People don’t have arch serie a only because of the top players in the top clubs in Italy.

The real issue however is the 6 billion dollar debt currency loan from international desperate shadster Jaimie Diamond and the vile organization known as JP Morgan Chase. Which is actually a room full of ancient corpses stuck in purgatory but that have found ways of possesing and controlling this living realm. This is such a pathetic desperate cash grab by whoever stands to benefit, literally the losers at the top of these 12 clubs are making a power play to ensure their lives of never ending indulgence and luxury could never come to a hault, and guess who they are sure will be the suckers to pay the debt?????? You, and me of course. So if you have a soul and love the game, DO NOT SUPPORT THIS, it has nothing to do with football and everything to do with permanantly lining the pockets of a handful of bloated slime."

If they go ahead and ban players from national duty it's going to stop them from playing in WC. The same WC which needs to be boycotted for being built on death of thousands of poor people. Now either boycott the fifa WC or this. Because all the top players from these clubs they wouldn't dare to ban them. If they ban them the Qatar  royal Kings will be coming with the whip to the UEFA officials. Again I am not trying to say this is perfect but WC needs to be boycotted anyway possible.

I would have stuck with Arsenal through anything that happened on the pitch - we could've been relegated to League Two and I still would have been there, going to games. This is different. It's a total betrayal of the fans. This isn't the club I fell in love with. Where are our values now?

I'm a Lille supporter and I see no problem with all the mega clubs in their own league. No more PSG 😂. Most of the supporters of those clubs are global anyway. There are more Barça fans outside Spain. Why not have an international super league that brings those clubs together on a weekly basis and globally with potential fixtures in China, America, Middle East, etc?"

European elite football has been a stagnant market for years, and needs a shake-up. This will make that shake-up happen, and beyond that it means nothing.

I'm baffled by Man Utd's decision to participate in this, to quote what Sir Matt Busby said ""Football is nothing without Fans"" clearly the fans mean nothing to  these owners."
chibuzoojukwu,2021-04-18T23:57:04Z,0,"This is not good but the Threats from the Premier League, La Liga, and other Domestic Leagues to ban these clubs won't work I'm afraid. FIFA's Threat and UEFA's Threat of banning players that participate in either the World Cup or Euros are the only REAL Threats to deter this Super League from happening. 
The Premier League CANNOT ban the Big 6 or threaten to relegate them lol. The Premier League is the richest league because of the amount of money TV companies pay them to broadcast their matches. TV Companies pay to show Man United matches and those teams that make up the Big 6. If the Big 6 are gone, there'll be fewer people watching the Premier League and the TV companies will make WAYY less money and they'll either cancel their contract with the Premier League or renegotiate for less money. The bottom line is that the Premier League will lose Financially if they ban or relegate the Big 6. The TV companies are CURRENTLY paying to show Big 6 matches not Fulham vs Aston Villa, unfortunately (because they have a less worldwide fan base)so yeah the Domestic league cant ban or kick out the Big 6 unfortunately because of the impact on their Finances if they do so. The Big Clubs know the Power they have. It's why they are Bold to reject their fans and outcry. They are doing it for the money, unfortunately. Barca and Madrid are in serious debt and this is serious gold for them to get their finances in order. The dumb Big 6 are bailing them out. Madrid and Barca will get the money they need, then proceed to keep attracting all the Big Players to play for them over the rest of the teams that make up the Super League. The ultimate winners will be Barca and Real Madrid. I can't fathom why the Big 6 would sign up for this when their Rivals in Spain are in dire financial pain. Why help them out after years of wasteful spending? I guess the allure of more money is hard to turn down especially for the owners."

 First of,if this is like a champions League 2.0 (they continue to play to their respective national comps for example premier league, fa cup etc) what is the real problem? They get more revenue and we get more ""high quality"" games.
Secondly the only reason uefa Will step in and try to stop this, is because they know they Will lose money, they dont care about football, most likely uefa Will back out and let them do this after they get a good share of the revenue
Lastly i heard that bayern dortmund and leipzig havent decided 100% so we might see them also in there. 
Hopefully whatever happens Will be optimal for the majority of teams/fans/orgs"

azlanj253,2021-04-18T23:15:07Z,0,"As much as I am sad to see this, what the Super League is trying to do is copy the financial success model of the NBA and F1. Sure, there are other basketball or racing series, but the one people want to watch are the elite competitions like NBA, or F1. On the business side, every major broadcast companies would want to sign the rights to play the Super League matches, which will result in big revenue. This will then attract bigger sponsor payouts. So, bigger revenue means higher salary wages, which then attracts the best players to play. FIFA and UEFA can ban these players from the World Cup or Euros all they want, but at the end of the day players play for the paycheck. In the future, kids around the world will grow up and dream of playing in the Super League. International competitions will be a non factor as the glamour and the glitz of fame and fortune can only come from playing in the Super League. As for the grassroots to find future talents, these elite clubs will be able to set up academies and youth competitions throughout the world to ensure the best talents only play in the Super League."

AgbahiweJack,2023-12-23T17:30:30Z,0,"Tbh I actually support the super league. People are saying things like it kills the tradition of football but I actually think it restores football. Hate the wealth of the EPL or not, you should agree that it has brought a lot of eyes to the beautiful game. Of course the 12 team super league is a horrific solution we can all agree. Take a look at the growth and expansion in popularity of the American sports league and even the India's cricket league, the IPL which all use the  franchise system.
The only problem is the prioritisation of money and extreme imbalance which actually already exists"

The game of soccer will continue to thrive either way.  Teams can always use a portion of the additional revenue they will be making from this league to sign more squad players into their lineups so they can enough players to play 5 leagues/tournaments simultaneously.

wraithwraith3291,2023-12-22T21:52:58Z,4,"I like to think the reason that a European Superleague has legs is because the best teams in the Big Five leagues dominate their respective domestic top flight football.

Even with points deducted, they manage to comfortably avoid relegation and also quality for UEFA competitions."

Competition needs a common good framework to function and take on corrupt mutual interests otherwise it's dysfunctional. It's utterly delusional to think privatizing the governance of competition is a good idea especially when private entities like clubs run by entitled twats are out to establish an elitist hierarchical class system. You have to be a f00l not to spot this is the creation of an oligarchy, an aristocracy..."
evanclp514,2023-12-21T22:35:54Z,0,"i honestly don't understand the opposition to the super league. it's only replacing the champions league. i don't get the argument of people saying it would hurt domestic competition. i think we can all agree that, right now, the champions league is mostly boring/pointless until at earliest the round of 16 if not the quarter-finals. most groups are extremely top heavy and the group stage is just a waste of time. the idea of having a mini league with all the elite teams playing each other from the start sounds much better to watch, in my opinion. you could do the top 5 from England, top 4 from Italy, top 3 from Spain, top 2 from Germany, and then champions from France, Portugal, Turkey, Netherlands, etc., and just have them all playing against each other mid-week throughout the season. more games against good teams so more big matches. i don't see the problem other than domestic league executives, fifa, and uefa fearing that less people will watch their matches in favor of the super league. in which case all they care about is money and not the quality of football or what the audience gets to see."

Clubs like Benefic, Marseille, Red Star, and other clubs want to retain glory again. This could provide financial means to build a better competition. Free games is always good.

The Premier League already hoggs all the money on all levels and has done for now 3 decades. Maybe keep it for the European Union countries. It makes alot more sense. UEFA as it stands the PL will generally walk over everyone in Conference League Europa League and in CL there is just 3 clubs outside the PL that can compete financially. Their revenues are soooo high that this year every PL club is in the top 30 richest revenue clubs in the world and just 10 will be outside the PL. The Premier League is only getting richer. This is the only way they can catch up or stabalize European football on a financial level. Aston Villas and West Hams revenue in the Conference League this year and last year was just so high in comparison to their competition. Same goes for the Europa League. Liverpool West Ham and Brighton are miles ahead of everyone except Leverkusen. Then they can keep their players longer and pay higher wages.

A Super League without English teams is worth nothing, because Italian, Spanish, German and French clubs don’t drive global viewership anywhere near the level of English teams, so they will not get top tier TV contracts for a league with no English teams. 

I get why Real Madrid and Barcelona want it because they see the writing on the wall. They both will be bankrupt in 20 years because they overspend on wages while the La Liga contract is shrinking in value. They literally have to win the champions league every year to break even. The Super League is the only thing that can save them financially, but they will not get the money they expect without English teams."

So the Super League whether it happens or not, for me I don't care about that as much as I care about UEFA and FIFA being put in check. If UEFA and FIFA had it their way rn, we would have never got things like the Premier League. The UCL format was getting stale and the next one is even worse, so if clubs see another way of evolving modern competition to make things more fun, then let them do it. Again I'll say whether that newer shinier competition will be the Super League or not, I don't care, I just care that UEFA and FIFA should not be allowed to hold a monopoly on football. Africa already had it's Super League, nobody complained about it (not even FIFA) because it didn't affect UEFA so let's have something that can challenge the UCL as well, once more I say whether that will be the Super League or not I don't care."
martinmcmartinezface4243,2023-12-21T16:26:20Z,5,"Another interesting advantage of the Super League is that we could see the best players of the world playing agaiinst each other more often. I mean, what was better than watching Messi vs CR7 on their prime? And how many times did we have the chance to see that? At least 2 per year, usually more. But that only was possible because they both played in the same league, otherwise we would only have had the chance of watching them playing against each other with their clubs like what,  2 times? As RM and Barcelona only faced each other once in the UCL during that period of time. 
With the superlague we would have the chance of watching the best players of the world facing each others on a regular basis, no matter if they play in different countries. 
The idea of the superleague sounds very attractive to fans that like to watch games between the beat teams of the world like myself. And if they offer the games for free... For me it's by far the most interesring proposal I've ever seen for football, I really hope it can be done."

pradhunechhetri8837,2023-12-21T15:19:39Z,8,This all happened because the UCL became a competition where top teams had to play more games. Its already a packed schedule for teams and also for the players. So the Super league is to create another league to separate the top teams. For a separate tournament and have lesser games to play in a season.

Where the issue to me is that Serie A and Eredivisie need to downsize and join the Bundesliga/La Liga. The issue isn't the EPL or Ligue 1, the issue is; Serie A, Bundesliga, Eredivisie and La Liga and those 4 leagues definitely need to make some changes."
SouradeepSBK,2023-12-21T15:06:11Z,1,"They tried to gaslight people into thinking that it's an ""Open"" competition. Everybody saw through that and opposed A22 in hours. Football is nothing without fans.

This is just a cynical cash grab by souless billionairres. As a united fan we have a history with the chanpions league going back to its founding, Matt Busby put us flrward for the competition because he thought it was important, we lost an entire generation of players, playing in this competition.

thisismarkmac,2023-12-21T14:19:06Z,0,"I’m starting to think that Gab and Juls are UEFA lapdogs. This is not that difficult to understand. The ruling is that UEFA/FIFA cannot have a monopoly regardless of whatever their “approval system” is. The approval system loophole they’re talking about is a red herring. No major country supports a monopoly in business and this ruling just reinforces that. Both UEFA and FIFA are extremely corrupt organizations that need to be overhauled, if not left behind. And then note the conciliatory tone they both take at the end. EU will always back the creation of a new league simply due to the principle of free market competition, this ruling now reinforces that and it becomes the norm whereas the old norm is the UEFA controls everything and couldn’t be challenged."

wir154,2021-10-28T15:24:02Z,1,"Sorry, this is a very long comment! Congratulations if you manage to read it all! Hopefully it addresses some of the suspect and in some cases, downright bullshit claims, supporters of the ESL come out with though! The amount of garbage I have read and heard from supporters of the Super League has been staggering! A few choice nuggets (and these are not direct quotes, but the gist of what people have sad!), are:

""Football is fucked already and UEFA and FIFA are corrupt, so people shouldn't be protesting about the ESL!""
Really? I'm not saying that the current situation isn't bad, but you do not fix something that is broken, by breaking it further! You don't try and put out a fire by throwing petrol on it! If you have a cake made from earwax and bogies to eat, you don't make it taste better by putting icing made from liquefied shit on it! As far as I am concerned the ESL has managed to do something difficult and made UEFA and FIFA look good!

""Four billion will watch the ESL!""-Florentino Perez. ""4,000 million (4 billion) watch Barca, Real etc.""- Some idiot on a YouTube comment!
Four billion is more than half the population of the entire Earth! Only a delusional fool would claim that that proportion of the Earth's population will ever watch football in total, never mind that far less than the true total of football fans would ever have watched the ESL! Certainly far less than currently watch the Champion's League would have watched it. The vast majority of people who would have watched it, already watch the Champion's League! However, large numbers of current Champions League viewers would have boycotted, or just not have been interested in it, either because their club was effectively excluded from it, or because they are against it in principle, or because they think it would be boring as fuck! Check out the protests from fans of included clubs, never mind the fans of excluded ones!

""The ESL is to save football!""-Florentino Perez
Bullshit! Football is the most popular it has ever been (despite 4 billion watching it claims being bollocks!) and has more TV, sponsorship and advertising money coming in to it, than ever. The ESL was to save the greedy, financially doping, debt ridden, self appointed ""elite clubs"" and keep them permanently at the top. A bit like a group of athletes pumping themselves full of drugs, to keep competitive in the Olympics, whilst also campaigning to restrict access to the Competition for athletes that might threaten their chances of taking all the medals! Yes, the Pandemic has hit some, but football survived 2 World Wars at a time when TV money etc. was non existent! How come my club Hibernian, can afford to put ""Thank You NHS"" on the fronts of their shirts, rather than getting a sponsor that would pay them to advertise, despite playing in a ""farmers league"", where surely they should be desperate for money? It wouldn't be because they live within their means, don't overspend and, shock, horror, sometimes make a profit, would it?

""The ""Dirty Dozen"" have always been the top clubs in Europe!""
Bullshit! Every one of them has had a lengthy barren spell in Europe and most have had lengthy barren spells domestically also at some time or other. I'm not saying they haven't all had successes in the past and aren't big clubs, but how many of them would be operating at their current level, without ""financial doping"", either by being bankrolled by billionaires, or by running up obscene debts! The ""Big Six"" have all had long spells without winning the English Title during my lifetime! Also Everton have won more Titles than 3 of them and, prior to 2005, with 9 Titles, had won 4 more than Tottenham (2) (and still 2!), Man City (2) and Chelsea (1), combined!

""The ""Dirty Dozen are the clubs that made football!""
Hmmm! My club was formed in 1875! I thought that that was earlier than every one of the ""Dirty Dozen""! Seems like they certainly didn't make them, at the very least!

""Since Liverpool got promoted in the early 1960's, none of the 12 clubs has ever spent time out with their top flights. It has just been smaller clubs that have been relegated!""- Someone pretending to be a Liverpool fan, who has checked Wikipedia about them, but has clearly neglected to do so for the other ESL clubs!
So it must just be my imagination that AC Milan were relegated for match fixing in the early 1980's and that in England, Man U, Tottenham and especially Chelsea and Man City, have been relegated since the mid 1970's! (City even had a season in the 3rd flight as recently as 1999!)

""These clubs have the vast majority of support amongst all the clubs in Europe!""
Really? So I assume Barca, with the largest ground in Europe and being one of this elite dozen, also get the largest average attendances at their games! _ _ _ Oh, wait a minute! It says here that Dortmund get Europe's highest average crowds! How can that be, when their ground holds 18,000 less than the Nou Camp and they aren't one of the ""Sacred Twelve""?

""No one wants to watch clubs from the ""farmers leagues""!""
Funny! I recall in 2016 a last 16 Scottish Cup replay between Hibernian (Hibs) and Heart of Midlothian (Hearts), played midweek, in the winter cold, on an evening when last 16 knock out Champions League matches were being aired on TV, which was more or less a sell out! How can that be? How can 2 ""peasant clubs"" from a ""farmers league"" (and not even the dominant Celtic and Rangers), get so many (and more than the last time Hibs played Liverpool there in Europe!), for an early round Cup replay, midweek, in the winter, when of course their fans should have been in front of the TV, gasping in awe, at Europe's ""elite"", playing in the Champion's League?

""Tottenham have won 37 major trophies!""
Look, if you are going to pretend to support a club, surely to fuck you can at least check your facts! Wikipedia is just one short click away! They have won 17, not 37! Even if you count their Charity/Community Shields and their 2 Second Division Titles, they are still nowhere close to 37! Yes they have won 3 European Trophies, but no European Cups/Champion's Leagues and just 2 League Titles (Their last one 60 years ago!)

""The vast number of football fans in the USA and in the likes of China and India, mean that European fans of European clubs are a tiny drop in the Ocean!""
Firstly, the USA has less than half the population of Europe and football (the original kind anyway!), is nowhere close to being the most popular sport there! Yes, it's true that Europe has little more than half the population of either China, or India, but anyone who thinks that far more people per head of population in Europe don't follow European football, compared to in those countries, is not living in the real World. A very high proportion of a lower number, can still be a large amount, compared to a lower proportion of a higher number. It's certainly likely that financially European fans, with their general affluence compared to most of the World's population and football being by far the most popular sport in most of it's countries (unlike in many countries out with Europe and South America!), contribute far more financially per capita to European football, than fans from any other part of the World do! Especially since they are far more likely to actually have a local tie to clubs from their own area! 
I am the first to admit though, that the ""Dirty Dozen"" probably still get a higher proportion of fans (albeit of suspect loyalties!) from elsewhere than they do in Europe itself! (Despite the fact that I have heard of/met some Japanese, Brazilian and US Hibs fans as well as a Mexican, a US and a Nigerian Hearts fan. Also, from Europe itself: a German Celtic fan (and even one who follows Dumbarton!) and English and Irish fans of Celtic, Hibs and Rangers!) On top of that, of all the people I know personally, who do support clubs from either England, or continental Europe, more than two thirds do not support ""Dirty Dozen"" clubs!"

cndacecandler6351,2021-04-27T09:47:00Z,0,"Background of the Event: 1996 to 1999
Since taking power in 1949, the CCP has launched a political movement every few years, targeting landlords, capitalists, intellectuals, and many other ordinary citizens. A few years after the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989, the CCP turned its attention to Falun Gong practitioners.

Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a meditation system based on the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. Rooted in traditional Chinese culture, it is fundamentally different from the CCP’s ideology of class struggle, hatred, and lies. Moreover, Falun Gong's miraculous power in improving health and character has also attracted numerous people to learn the practice.

1996: Defamation in Newspapers

Guangmin Daily, one of the major newspapers in China targeted at intellectuals, published a commentary attacking Falun Gong on June 17, 1996. People familiar with the CCP’s history suspected that the article signaled the CCP's intention to ruin Falun Gong's reputation.

One month later, the General Administration of Press and Publication, an agency under the CCP’s Publicity Ministry, issued a policy on July 24, 1996. Sent to Press and Publication Bureaus in each province, the policy forbade the publication of Zhuan Falun and China Falun Gong, the main teachings of Falun Gong and bestselling books in Beijing."

CEngelbrecht,2021-04-21T14:20:17Z,0,"Silly suggestion that has stolen my sleep these last few days. For purely sportive reasons, not financial, I'm actually excited about a European continental league with all the greatest teams from 150 years of association football tradition duking it out every year. Fuck the money. The teams still have to bloody qualify, they must be promoted as well as relegated. Sport is first, money second, the American solution ain’t gonna work on the European continent. Sure, money is a very practical sociological tool, but it turns people into tools, some things are Olympian and above money. (Sorry, gotta breathe…)

Anyway, here's my attempt at what the ESL setup should have been, if money hadn't blinded the sheiks:

A new continental league (NCL?), under UEFA, will replace the current CL, playing for the same Big Ears trophy to continue its history. Fuck it, keep calling it Champions League, now it’s just an actual annual league. This new league will then be the only league tournament these teams play that season (!), after they’ve qualified. Teams are still on for the FA Cup, Copa del Rey, national team cups, etc.

The European football continent is divided into 10 tiers, with current national leagues acting as qualification for the NCL and/or the playoffs. You could go only by region, but I also believe that a few national leagues will need to be their own tier due to their established history. Everybody has their national pride, but sportively, some leagues have ended up standing out in the football world, what can you do?

Own tier: The English Premier League (4 teams in NCL)

Own tier: The Spanish Liga (4 teams in NCL)

Own tier: The Italian Serie A (4 teams in NCL)

Own tier: The German Bundesliga (4 teams in NCL)

Tier, Celtic Europe: (2 teams in NCL)
Northern Ireland
Republic of Ireland
Scotland
Wales

Tier, Western Europe: (4 teams in NCL)
French Ligue 1
Dutch First Division
Belgian First League
Portuguese First Division
Andorra
Gibraltar
Luxembourg

Tier, Northern Europe: (2 teams in NCL)
Denmark
Faroe Islands
Finland
Iceland
Norway
Sweden

Tier, Central Europe: (2 teams in NCL)
Austrian Bundesliga
Czech Republic
Hungary
Liechtenstein
Poland
San Marino
Slovakia
Switzerland

Tier, Southern Europe: (3 teams in NCL)
Armenia
Azerbaijan
Georgia
Greece
Turkey
Albania
Bosnia and Herzegovina
Bulgaria
Croatia
Cyprus
Israel
Malta
Kosovo
Montenegro
North Macedonia
Romania
Serbia
Slovenia

Tier, Eastern Europe: (3 teams in NCL)
Russian Premier League
Ukrainian Premier League
Belarus
Estonia
Kazakhstan
Latvia
Lithuania
Moldova

At the beginning of each season, each tier has a playoff tournament maybe two, four weeks long, maybe more. The national champions and/or runners up from the previous season now compete against the teams playing the NCL the previous season, for the total number of 32 NCL spots for that coming NCL season. After those playoffs, the teams who haven’t qualified continue playing their respective national tournaments, while the NCL commences play with the qualified teams. Any NCL champion can get relegated at the start of the following season.

Go ahead. Piss all over me for ruining football too. I do see the problem in one of my proposed tiers having 18 (!) countries, and how the hell to have a playoff for e.g. 3 NCL spots? You’re bound to unintentionally piss on national feelings no matter what."

sdfkjguytdy1646,2021-04-21T01:50:06Z,1,"CCP Deep Involvement in Organ Harvesting
The CCP has been heavily involved in forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience. This practice has lasted for over 10 years, yet the CCP has been denying it.

MP Sinčić said that among all transplant surgeries in the world, two-thirds of the patients went to China for surgery. In Croatia, for example, one has to wait many years for an organ transplant. In China, the wait time is much shorter and is often only days. It is unlikely that the CCP does not know the significance of this discrepancy. In fact, the regime has been actively participating in the forced organ harvesting, although it keeps lying about it at the same time. In the end, organ harvesting has become a tool for the CCP to eliminate political dissidents and to make huge profits. 

Sinčić said that when he first learned about the CCP's forced organ harvesting several years ago, as a human being, he was very angry. He also felt bad because hardly any high officials in the international community had taken action to stop this. 

Joint Efforts Required
Sinčić remarked that it is good that in 2021, more and more attention has been paid to the CCP's forced organ harvesting. This means that more people have heard about it and more conferences have been held to discuss the issue. 

Stopping the crime also requires joint efforts from different countries. As a MEP, Sinčić said that the European Union had not openly criticized the CCP due to concerns over business relations with China. He said that this needs to end and that people’s lives should be placed in the highest priority. He stressed that it is time to stop the fear of the CCP, so that the European Union and the world in general will take a position against the regime. 

Some foreign companies have also benefited from the organ harvesting and organ trade, including companies from Europe, the United States, and other Asian countries. Furthermore, many global businesses are also connected to the forced labor system in China. 

Sinčić proposed to investigate the firms involved, followed by sanctions against those businesses as well as individuals. He said that now is the time for the international community to say no to the forced organ harvesting in China."

JohnSmith-kj8om,2021-04-20T17:59:45Z,0,The announcers asked the question why would anyone want to play a game where there’s not pyramid/relegation format. Well the answer is lots. This super league would essentially follow the format of American Sports. Which generally do well financially in major sports (see NBA & NFL) and they’re only really in one country.  For that matter you could even go and see what college football does in the US revenue wise. If UEFA release control and let these teams play domestically and for players to be able to play for country I doubt this will do anything more than add professional talent to the world stage.  These clubs will need more players for all the fixtures and the domestic totals will still run as they always have. Figure out a champions league light and it seems like this won’t be as big a deal as everyone is reacting to. Just my two cents.

It is that players and their agent ruining the game with their money-grabbing. These clubs have to find a way to make money or they bust.
Simple as that. This Superleague is a byproduct of the greed that already exist in football. You can't pay Garth Bale £600k a week and think

Above all, I'm also very afraid that this European League involves a lot of money and power, and that, eventually, it will happen...But I believe that, WE, the fans...the players...the coaches...the media and all those who love this Global Sport...WE also have a lot of power!! 💪 💪 💪

I hope Europe stops this BS. I NEVER LIKE THE SUPER LEAGUE FORMAT and the way they organized the competition as there is no competition anyway and no reward/relegation for winning or losing as the same team plays year in year out. The core essence of sports does not exist in this format. It is pure business and GREED."

Mantis_Toboggan_MD.,2021-04-20T13:47:26Z,0,"They practically closed off the Champions League about 10-15 years ago anyway.

You still occasionally get a club like Ajax for example getting a run to the Semi-Finals but by and large it's the same handful of clubs contesting the Semis/Quarters every season.

But even that isn't good enough for the big clubs because there is still a glimmer of hope for the smaller clubs to get through the qualifiers, reach the group stage and advance to the latter stages at the expense of a Milan or a Chelsea etc...

The EPL already gets FOUR automatic entries to the CL but that's still not enough. They now basically want six! and not just the best six based on performances on the field (that'd mean West Ham & Leicester being part of the 6 based on this years standings) but based on a self selected group that will be set in stone and will never be subject to change via relegation/promotion.

So even if there is a compromise and UEFA allow six EPL clubs automatic CL entry instead of the current four, it'll only be delaying things a few years becasue the first time a club like Man Utd or Chelsea finish outside the ""Top 6"" all of this will come up again because Man Utd came 7th and Wolves or Crystal Palace or whoever had the audacity to finish 6th etc..."

Therefore even the lower divisions teams will be working extra hard and become more creative to try and make it to the super league.

The FAs & Leagues won’t ban & expel clubs cause it will be taken to court & the FAs & Leagues will fold cause it will be ruled as unlawful & discriminatory.

The courts will be in the Super Leagues corner over Discrimination unlawful sanctions & breaching players human rights over every sanction threatened.

Plus government can’t pass any bill or law that is discriminatory unlawful & breaches human rights cause the courts will overturn them.

The UEFA and the tv channels are angry and spitting misinformation bc they will be hit financially when the big clubs leave the ECL. And by the way if most of the money is generated by these big teams why would the UEFA get all the money and use it on all the other teams and its own organism. Cut the middle man. Let the clubs make this better version ECL. People hate on this project come from fear of change and ignorance. This will be the future.

vladimirshinkarev5813,2021-04-20T09:02:12Z,0,"I can't understand all these Super League naysayers. All they are talking about is how bad it is and how it'll kill the football spirit. What the heck is the football spirit anyway? They use fancy Robin-Hood-like communist slogans: ""Created by the poor, stolen by the rich"". Was it stolen though? I tend to think that it was refined, developed, and brought to a new level. What football would look like without great managers like Perez? I doubt that we would have all these nice big stadiums.

It has suddenly become bad to be rich. Although, the only thing that differs between the rich and the poor is that the latter are too lazy to work as hard as the first. Perez was able to attract previously unimaginable investments for the creation of the Super League. Undoubtedly, this will only benefit the development of the game.

People for some mysterious reason desperately support UEFA. But what have they done for the development of football? All they seem to do is to fail big clubs. Hence, the CEOs had to act to save their businesses. And be not mistaken, a football club first and foremost is a company. Thus, its main role is generating income. And there's nothing bad about it. Put yourself in Perez's shoes. What would you do in his situation? How would you act? Imagine the US government telling Tim Cook to cut down the production of iPhones because America needs more Motorolas. Hilarious, right?

UEFA has shown its real face of greedy bureaucrats, dictators, and usurpers in this situation. People who threat to ban anything are not good. But even their threats would benefit the Super League. They don't favor letting players leaving for national matches anyway. And why do people fight so much for national leagues and competitions? Do they promote patriotism? Isn't it just another word for racism? It would explain why there are so many so-called 'fans', who are ultras, in reality, supporting UEFA. If you still don't understand why the Super League is a good idea and why UEFA is a harmful organization, I would highly recommend you read some of Ayn Rand's books.

Anyway, I would like to appreciate Florentino Perez and his partners for this bold move and to wish to overcome all the challenges in the nearest future. In the dark times, we live indeed."

Income from 'game going' fans is minimal for the top league clubs, and the FA, UEFA et al are utterly useless and haven't moved the game on in decades and changes they do make are generally awful (VAR anyone?), it is no wonder top business folk who run these clubs want something different (they are successful for a reason).
Players and ruthless agents earning vast monies that few if any actually deserve, it's no wonder they've been quiet about it all, given that they what ever statement made the player will have earned more in the time taken to  say it, than most fans do in a year. 
Fans stupid enough to pay through the nose for stuff that costs pennies to make and and made in sweatshops by child labour. 
Hypocrisy is rife throughout it all so let them go, what does it matter to all the other teams, and if they make a better job of what we have today, then all teams could go across and F the FA."

That straight away will take millions if not billions from all of the other football teams clubs small, medium, and large, and it will kill real compotion eg seeing giant killer's coming from nowhere and toppling one of the premier clubs. If this goes ahead it will be a dark day for the fans, you might only be able to watch this closed league on TV and pay per view cutting off millions of people who might not have the means to pay for subscription TV a sad day.

Both the Semis used to be live on the Beeb and meant something, and these two chaps - along with every top English player after 1991 - were expected to turnout for cash money in a divisive (rich man's)  league that helped destroy the FA Cup as the focal date in the English sporting calendar along with the Champion's League also. Nothing personal - these two are okay as they had to work their way up from nothing compared to how some players are introduced, just like Jamie Vardy they have a full spectrum experience of English football. So no hard feelings. Just fact, contrasting somewhat with when Ferdinand and Neville went OTT on satellite over this. 
This ESL could have been ANY rich boy's competition in any era. The difference being this time there's more people to sanction against it. 
One good thing about this is at least it highlights the hypocrisy of the FA, PFA, PL, EFL, FIFA, UEFA  and also the Media and ex Players who took good contracts in the top flight and looked the other way when the likes of Bury went to the wall or Notts County disappeared from the fully professional level altogether. 
Murphy and Dublin are sincere but, y'know, we remember and players and managers aren't going to strike or protest over this now are they?!?

*BT Sport have about 3 viewers and I'm not signing up any time soon to be the 4th, which is why I don't really bother with the Champion's League either.

jhamler1,2021-04-20T02:12:11Z,0,"Bullshit. The money never trickles down. Never has and never will. If you believe that malarkey you're daft. This intra-continental ""super"" league thing is the bestest news to happen to European football since American Football showed the world how a franchise system is the bestest system even as the American system of capitalist socio-economic politics is utterly ruinous. European football is currently a vulture capitalist/populist bullshit endeavor. For a hundred years they've been making you and your fanbase think you've gotta chance to win and become rich and that's how the powers that be are controlling your emotions. With this super league move, football becomes truly socialist. And more competitive. Institute a talent draft and a salary cap. FOR the working class fan and the wider football pyramid or whatever the fuck you wanna call it. My club, Fulham, will finally have a shot to be champions of England if the top six clubs recuse themselves from the EPL and join the continental league. Don't fight the status quo, but rather use the momentum of the status quo against it. Use your heads, in other words, as opposed to clinging to tradition. For chrissakes."
fusionsuper34,2021-04-20T02:11:09Z,0,"England's so called '' best league in the world '' is more corrupt than ever. Because of six clubs who put their financial assets before their loyal supporters in the UK and worldwide. 

Thank god the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 did not sign up to this bad idea. America along with many other foreign international owners have poisoned English football. 

The players should form an alliance and say no to this plan, if the clubs they represent refuse to listen, they should strike. The managers and players will not accept this at all.

As a fan I did not lose my club, the club lost me. If Chelsea Football Club do this from next season, I will never wear the shirt ever again.

Those fans work for their money to buy season tickets, memberships and merchandise at the stadiums. Havent the clubs realised that fans will no longer attend or that the world is in the middle of a bloody pandemic nightmare? Guys and girls we might as well support a team in the Efl. I am lifelong Peterborough United fan and I go to games whenever I can but I don't want to buy a season ticket because the price is too much. I have bills to pay."

Most of the owners are foreign, they have no emotional attachment to the clubs and their communities apart the expected profit. Many of the owners [not all of them] are having finances coming from dubious sources but PL committee still authorised the sales!!!!! They don't have balance sheets like other businesses and most of the players are overpaid!!! Create ""salary cap"" and make strong regulations for club finances and maybe reduced foreign players in club like in the past, each club must have youth teams and certain % of club's , reduce money from advert etc. go back to the ""grass roots"" we will see what will happened. For example Arsenal was first team playing without English/British players, 90% of France national team players are  from Africa [that's nothing racist ] can you imagine all those players playing e.g. fo Nigeria, Senegal, Ivory Coast teams, they would be amazing and maybe winning world cup.

help cover the costs of lesser teams

And Im not surprised Manchester United is in this, not because of Manchester United. But because of the owners. I dont belive for a second that this what the club really wants. A football club isnt the owners club. It is and allways will be the community and the supporters club. And im not surprised that the owners of Manchester United, Glazers is at the very top of this ""pyramid"" as vice president. I however a bit surprised that the two at the top, Vice president and president is from both the Manchester clubs. Im very interested to see what is gone happend the next coming days and weeks.

And I feel very sorry for the likes of Jurgen, Ole, Thomas, Arteta, Pep and the rest of the managers at these clubs. They have been put in very bad position. They are now where they are gone be asked about this every singel day. Just stop it. For real, stop it.

Side note: Kind of idiotic to read about FIFA and UEFA talking about moral of this, after this whole thing with the World Cup given to Qatar aswell. Time for the supporters and the media to take a stand, media has alot of power here to help supporters, help the game, they can have a big part to say here. That thing that is on the arm on every shirt that says ""respect"" is invalid if this is something that is gone happend. Its a disrespect towards the campaign of respect."

I've never been a great football fan, nor never will, but if this utter shite goes forward, including especially with Liverpool, the backlash from all the fans, friend and foe alike, will be monumental ...

A few diehards will stay true, but given this is a massive middle finger to most, suddenly you're gonna see a seismic shift as thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of fans switch their allegiance to lower, or even local clubs, because they will be pissed, and will not stand for this crap ... 

Which may actually result in nothing more than a Phyric victory for the ESL, as suddenly all the money that the fans would have spent on them, gets moved to those not involved in that crap ...

... at least one would hope ...

Personally, I say, give it a season, or maybe three, and without a self-sustaining fan base, they'll be as good as dead ...

... and then those same clubs will come crawling back, after the ESL collapses ...

If they have agreed now to go in to it next Season, then stop Tottenham and City in the League Cup Final this Sunday. Give the League Cup to Brentford as they got to the Semi Finals, the other team in the Semis United are a part of the six so forget them also. Uefa should also kick Arsenal and United out of Europa League and Chelsea and City from the Champions League. The Premier League should also kick Chelsea out of the F.A Cup and award it to Leicester, in the League Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea, United, Liverpool and City should be relegated as from now. Then let the others play out the remaining fixtures against each other to see who wins the League. It is no surprise that there are 6 Clubs from England being asked to be Founding Clubs, compared to only 3 in other Countries. The Spanish Clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona are in debt, so are Juventus in Italy. It is no surprise that the Premier League is the most viewed League in the World. Not to mention the Premier League Clubs get much more money in TV Revenue that what they do in other Countries. Clubs in the Premier League don't have to worry about income compared to other Clubs around the World (excluding PSG). The issue now is the other big Clubs around Europe can see that the Premier League is getting stronger. Clubs can compete now with wages, transfer fees and are getting stronger in Europe. In the next 10 Years the Premier League Clubs will dominate European Football and the Premier League will get bigger and will get more money in TV Revenue. It it a more Competitive League compared to all the others, the F.A Cup is the most glamorous Domestic Cup Competition in the World. So there is no reason for English Clubs to want to join the Super League, the only reason is greed and wanting more money. Also it doesn't help that most of the Clubs are owned by owners from Abroad, who don't care about the tradition of English Football and it's History. I can see why others want English Clubs to Join because like I said they are in Debt, so they need the Money to get out of it, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus. These Clubs all should be punished and made examples of, Italy did it to them teams who were Fixing Matches. They all got relegated including the biggest Club Juventus, so that's what should be down when Clubs show total disrespect to their Fans and the League they represent"

rooneye,2021-04-19T15:10:05Z,1,"Fair play to Bayern for having none of it. The German clubs are partly owned by fans as we all know and it's an awesome model I'd LOVE to see implemented here. And fucking PSG of all clubs?! Hats off to them as well (If they've said no or whatever, they certainly aren't involved at this stage anyway). It can't go ahead surely? NO ONE wants it. Just the greedy few owners. Mainly American owners .The Super League just STINKS of USA football. The name, the rules, the no consequences or relegations etc. Tottenham owner Joe Lewis is the only English guy with what seemed like a genuine connection to the club and not just a vehicle to make as much money from it as possible, so it's an even bigger betrayal by him. I mean we've always knew the other guys couldn't give a fuck about the game or the fans really.

I just can't see Sky or BT wanting to have this on their channel with all the hate. Maybe Amazon? ITV? BBC surely wouldn't want to be seen as fucking ruining football (which any channel that pays them will be, because without a TV deal it just can't happen. That's where the big money is). 

Boris has said he won't allow it, whatever that means. FIFA need to come out and say any players playing in that can't play in World Cups, UEFA same with Euro's and CL/EL etc. that will stop it too. Players won't want to miss out playing in the WC. Premier League has already said the 6 teams can fuck right off out of the PL if they try this. I can't see it happening. Too many parties against it. Powerful ones. They can't do it with all those against them. Fans certainly don't want it. Players won't either. Led by the Real Madrid President too, Florentino Perez. He can fuck right off. 

All these clubs are a disgrace. I bet their managers are FURIOUS and the club looking shameful. Klopp and his players must be fucking FUMING and HATE this. I mean Liverpool ffs have a great rep as a proper club that has a REAL connection with their fans That's been shattered now. ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" that sentiment has been shit on. 

I remember the Big Picture shit from last year when my chairman (Steve Gibson at Boro) came out in support of it. He's treated like a GOD here. He's our HERO. And we were shocked that he supported it. It just didn't seem like something he would think would be right. He NEVER shames us, but that day he did. So I can only imagine what shame and utter disgust Liverpool/Man Utd etc. fans are feeling right now."

I disagree with the fact that 15 clubs will automatically be entered into the Super league I think that it should be open to all clubs that succeed in doing well in the premier league or has some kind of criteria to enter the Super league because not all the 15 teams that are entering the super league will remain the best forever neither should they be guaranteed millions every year to play in this league to stay the best in the world forever.

First the British Clubs just had local lads playing for them.
Then there were transfers between clubs.
Then there were International transfers and players from abroad were allowed to play for your local team.
Now they want to have an ESL based on just elite European clubs just as someone below has said is right at the time where there are no fans to be seen!
And then we might think of the known plan to divide the world into 10 regions of which Europe is one of those regions.
Yes, great powers are at work  in achieving this and this ESL seems like it is part of this plan."

monkeybone39,2021-04-19T12:20:43Z,0,Fact is this started way back when the Prem Lg started and when the Champs Lg was changed up to allow non- champions in. Its a bit rich to call this greed when the system we have is built on nothing but greed and profit margins - clubs are on the stock market. I didnt hear Gary Neville shouting about club dominance  when United were flying. Im undecided but we ALL know the FA is not fit for purpose and UEFA and FIFA have continually been linked with corruption; some proven. As for slating the owners? They easily forget that it took these owners to bail these clubs out; both LFC and United were nearly in administration. Methinks there's a few jobs on the line and some are looking after their own greed.  Dont ve fooled by broadcasters such as Sky or even the prem lg; who have NEVER had supporters needs at the fore - remember the failed pay per view or the change of schedules (at a whim)  for TV purposes; leaving fans (year on year) out of pocket. The old 'change 'cycle' is at play; Suggest change - anger ensues. Explain change - gain (some) understanding. Highlight wider benefits to all - wider  acceptance.

Can the champion league sustain the high wage demands of these players the fans so wish for . 
If it’s purity of football you wish for then introspection is sort . We as fans have gladly walked down this path leading to this decision of the super league. We sold our clubs to investors many moons ago and rubed our hands at the thought of the players we could buy .

Let the so-called big clubs make this move.  If fans make a stand, and refuse to watch the product on principle, then it will fail.  If it fails, these club owners will lose money as well as bargaining power moving forward.  And if this is further compounded by UEFA/FIFA/National Leagues actually holding firm on their threats of not letting these clubs qualify for competitions, and players not play for their countries, then this will prove to be one of the worst financial decisions any of these teams will ever make.
That is how WE, the people, can grasp back the control of the game we love.  
The German league has already proven that prioritising fans/ticket prices can still make good money for clubs, and a highly competitive product that is sustainable/profitable/beloved by fans.  Leicester City have proven that the 'Big Six' in English football don't have a god-given right to automatically be considered the best every year.
Yes, money is already a driving force for success, but its not a guarantee, and no fan begrudges bigger clubs making more money than smaller clubs.  But this is just a next-level move based solely on greed, and the fans need to remind these clubs that they cannot be forgotten/ignored.
Again, if we all refuse to watch the product, the advertisers will not pay the broadcasters, and in turn the broadcasters will not pay for the matches, and in turn the clubs will lose money, and the whole idea will simply fail.  And if it fails, it goes away quickly.  It really is that simple, fans/consumers still have the power to control the flow of money, let's use this as an opportunity to remind them of that."

Big money teams like psg Barcelona etc already attract the best players because of the money and fame of champions leagues. Then we have  teams in China etc are stealing all our best players because of the ludicrous amounts of money they can throw at them
Now hear me out
Imagine a league that has the best of the best money is no object. The worlds best players playing in a tournament everywhere pitting up to the best the world has to offer
Yes other teams are angry because they dont have the promised seat guaranteed of course they are.
But if they can structure it in such a way that teams that win the league have the option to play against the worlds best with all the money benefits for that year it would be epic
Who here hasn't played fifa all-stars team 
They need seated guaranteed placements because of teams have players on 1 million  2 million 10 million a week and they get relegated the clubs would very fast go bankrupt. 
Now imagine it from a players point t of view. They are guaranteed to play in the biggest stage in the world pitted against the best of the best
And other teams and players wanting to get the chance to play against those teams. Or players dreaming of the chance to play in those teams. 
This all ready happens its called rhe champions league.
How many times have we all said if Liverpool or man u or Barcelona or any of rhe big teams don't preform domestically and get into the champions league they will lose their best players who will want to join a team on the champions league
The issue with it as I see it is that fifa uefa and other governing bodies have threatened individual players and teams to not join this league or they will be punished and be expelled from domestic leagues and cups etc. So the teams have decided that yes maybe if we have the best of rhe best it would be unfair in domestic leagues for the other teams who wont have the funds to compete.
So they said let's break away so not to damage the leagues as they are.
They can still run the pyramid scheme as it is today and this will have no impact upon them. Leagues will be the same minus the teams and players and managers  that join. 
Everything will be the same domestically and in the champions league minus those teams and players. 
This gives teams that would normally never have the chance to compete in those competitions the chance and ability to do so. 
It takes the cash cows out of domestic leagues making it fairer. 

I know this is not a popular idea but as it stands these teams already run domestic and Cup competitions with the ludicrous amounts of money they have compared to their domestic rivals  

I personally think its a great idea 
If they can structure it correctly and have some kind of trickling doen effect of the money into domestic leagues I think it could be a world class league with a world class competition and could be a win win for everyone. 
Fifa and uefa have had 10s of years to to change the structure of the competitions to make it more balanced and fair. But have failed to do so at every single turn
They cant and won't adapt to the current situation of multi billionaire clubs out spending everyone
This could be epic if we take our nostalgia of the past out of the equation and get behind it"

In general the more money you have, the more you spend, the more you win (and the more money you make).  City being in this supposed top six make me laugh.  It is just because of money!  Aston Villa have more history than them but clearly that does not matter anymore. YNWA"

You lot and SKY and all television companies as well as FIFA and FA could have stopped this from happening by protecting FOOTBALL from invasion of the MULTIMILLION star players being bought by greed. if the FIFA and FA did their jobs and you lot, then each Team from each City would have had to play the working class players from their own cities. But you see you guys working for Corporations ALLOWED the invasion of  international stars instead of spending the money in the very City structure using Cities as team boundaries as  only play players from your own City then you are where Matt is talking about. We all knew football was spiraling out of control for money allowing CORPORATIONS  to buy and then soak up the profits and drain our  Cities from seriously needed investments for those working classes living in poverty. But no companies like yours looked down on the working classes never lifting a finger to demand that the working classes are protected let alone the fans who have had to spend  nearly all their earnings just to watch their own City or towns play a game off soccer the money was more interesting that is why Sky  BT BBC ITV etc charge extortionate prices yet you need all tv companies to watch your team or you only have top six teams and still miss the odd game or pirates sites and then hammer the poor working classes for using these sites because you money grabbing tv companies drained the fans from cash and still they cannot see their teams play. sp This the the DEATH of football as we knew it. STOP using the working classes to win your argument  you could have reported the truth over the past 100 years why now when the damage is done the horse bolted ? Many fans are returning back to the saturday sunday pitches to watch for a couple of euros or pounds FAMILY Day out ? Did Man UTD not set up another team? and are now doing well because they could not afford the Man utd prices it PROVED a point F.C. UNITED PUNK FOOTBALL WELL EVERY TEAM EPECIALLY ARSENAL FC should do this claim back our GAME like Matt said it is the Fan that make the team the working classes from their own City or Town ."

ktmsports4241,2021-04-19T09:47:02Z,1,"European Super League is not a good choice but look at the prize money that UEFA offers for world's biggest competition. Premier League TV rights is bigger than prize money and that is the explanation on itself. Money is pouring from left and right in football but clubs like Real Madrid, Barca won't be able to compete against European giants like PSG or city. Where is FFP? UEFA ignored all those calls for violation of FFP and all of a sudden they are a victim now? 
Change is necessary because even in UCL final, they offer 50% seats to fans of both team and rest goes to sponsorship, so this didn't hamper beauty of football? Yes, UCL is a historic competition but reform is necessary in the tournament. 
Perez did the right thing for the club and the future he is building for Real Madrid. If you don't agree, it's up to you but FIFA and UEFA needs to sort out their act and bring fair play in football, if the tournament is to continue."

No,we don't know the answer exactly.Maybe they have a good reason why they want to lift the Super league...Do we hear from la liga.Seria or from the other country say something.Only English sport journalist say so many things.
What can KDB.Kane.Rashford.Lacazatte.Salah.Kante or Pep.Ole. Jose.Tuchel.Arteta   and Klopp say to Super league.. no or yes to Super league..If they say no to Super leageu, you have to leave your Club.

I've been a liverpool fan for over a decade not being born there. Yet still wanting to wear that jersey even if they were slipping away. This is worst than a break up with someone. This marriage lasted for so long for it to just end here because ms.liverpool met uefa behind my back is a sting. With prices being so inflamed unsure how the players will be treated. Will they be able to leave without a big price on thier head? Will they simply play out thier contract and then leave for free?

If this goes ahead I won't be following that team anymore on principal of knowing what's right from wrong, fair from selfish. Money has been slowly ruining football for about 2 decades and this is the straw that had broken the camels back. As a 5 year old I picked Chelsea because they were so bad but entertaining through the entire 1980's, I've watched them bounce from the old division 2 to the first division, get to semi finals and lose to win a few cups and then ultimately win leagues. Every club that's won the Premier League has thrown cash at it, it's the only real way of doing it however Man Utd aside nobodies had a massive prolonged period of total dominance because our bottom teams have always been able to make it competitive, that's what an underdog does. 

This Super League removes that almost entirely aside from 5 teams who can qualify to essentially be that seasons fodder for these huge clubs. The Premier League will then suffer for years as being champion of the country won't really mean being champion of the country at all with 6 teams missing. The FA Cup and Chocolate Buttons Cup will also be diminished with very few instances of giant killing ever happening again.

Mark this date in your mind people, this is the exact moment when the game we love so much died."

iantaylor620,2021-04-19T08:54:44Z,0,Honestly football has eaten itself. But despite how disgraceful and tasteless this all this I can honestly see this happening. Does anyone really think the premiere league are going to kick those 6 clubs out of the league? Really? Ban basically the whole of the England team from playing for their country? No chance. The premier league will yap and moan about greed bla bla the usual rubbish then negotiate a deal with the organisers of the super league to be compensated for financial loss and they'll end up no better than the ones they're castigating. It's the fans that get trodden on yet again. After years of being fleeced the club's have decided they've bled us dry and let's move on to something else. Total shambles.

Personaly i love the idea of watching Neymar and Mbappe playing against Messi and Ronaldo  and all other stars at this level instead of hoping for them to be drawn against each on UCL! I think its a great idea, we all know that these clubs are the best historicaly .You cant place Leicester in this coz they won that one time and compare with What the other clubs having been doing for so long."

Because the Super League didn't say that those clubs and players cannot continue to play in UCL, leagues and world cup... so they aren't the ones causing that level of repercussion.

The top clubs without whom there would be no Champions league, just cannot compete against state owned clubs and illicit funding. UEFA who turn a blind eye when certain clubs infringe their joke of FFP regulations, are doing absolutely nothing to remedy the problems of hyper inflation, sick agents' thieving antics and totally immoral transfer fees. The implosion has been inevitable for years. The guilty parties are not these clubs, they are Fifa, Uefa, and every other greedy domestic organisation, along with the television companies, the mainstream and social media who do nothing other than complain, criticize, insult, and act with contempt. Too many bloodsuckers have sucked the life out of what was once a great sport."

The premier league and other bodies need to stand up for the fans and those teams who stand with their fans. Let them go on the understanding they can’t play in their own league or cup competitions. If they change their minds they still need to be fined and deducted points for even threatening to do this. This is the time we need to stand tall and stand up to these bullies of the football world. Why should they dictate who is allowed what and who is the top six? They need punishments done now. Only then will the fans across the uk will feel we are in this together against such greed."

saucyisawesome,2021-04-19T06:52:11Z,0,I love it. This will make the league more fair since  all the league has been a no fair league in the first place. It’s always the team with the most money that never gets relegated anyways. If there was a salary cap then I’d believe all the hate that comes from it but since there’s no salary cap then I say go with the super league. It’s only fair. I always see the same teams with money in the top 10 over and over. I don’t blame super league. I blame all the leagues or fifa for not having salary cap. We always see all the attractive players in one team. Where’s the competition in that? If there was a salary cap then we’d see the likes of Mbappe to West Brom or some club and make that club more attractive to watch mostly because of him. Vote for Salary Cap. It will do good for all the leagues and clubs since it will have a trickle down effect. Which would make all team attractive to watch instead of the same big teams over and over.

In the end, it’s a money transaction for these people in power. Greed can be a disease if you allow it. Issue with ownership is that once they get more, they want more. It’d be dope if they simply created the ‘Super League’ as just another major competition minus the breakaway. They could’ve worked that out. It’s the “breakaway” that’s devastating the world."

I don't want this to happen, but it might mean that the only way to preserve  full domestic league seasons (e.g., La Liga, Premier League) is to allow this new Super League to replace the Champions League."
Leo-Bassment,2021-04-19T06:01:16Z,0,"The rich trying to get richer! Germany but also Portugal and Spain , their clubs are also owned by the people. Benfica  and FC Porto have more history  in the Champions League then lets say Tottenham . I can't believe Real Madrid and Barca accepted to be part of this, I guess money talks! What bullshit! Who wants to see a football league where you know the founding clubs will never be relegated just because? Football is about fair competition,  where the  best performers , the champions , move up because of merit and the lowest performers move down! It's a fair system , everyone plays against everyone else, everyone has a shot at being the champion! 
Imagine if someone came up wih an idea and do that in professional boxing? Pick the top 20 richest promotors and let them and their boxers fight eachother only. No one else outside of the ""Club""  will have  a shot at one of  those guys? What a stupid , unfair and selfish idea! How can you call yourself the true champion ? We the fans and lovers of sports and competition want fairness and the competition open for all according to merit, not bank account of the owners! 
I hope all football fans around europe and around the world stand up and let their opinions known! People, the fans have paid with their money for tickets for football matches to see their club play! Fans' money, passion , support and love built the Clubs! I do think however that there are many things that FIFA and UEFA need to do , because the way it is right now could be improved! Salaries of players are just insanly disproportionate, agents fees are too high as well, sponsors are getting greedy , players will soon be wearing a brand stamped on their foreads if they are not careful!   Business partners are welcome, we need them,  but this money thing is destroying the spirit of the game and of sport competition in general. Maybe a Super League could be created by joining both the Champions League and Europa League into to one big, giant 'Super' competition , divided in groups , a little like the Europa Nations League, with the top teams ranked in the higher group according to merit and the lowest ranked at the bottom, but where there's promotion and relegation from every group. At least it would be open and fair to all! Fiorentino Perez & Co...shame on YOU!"

Fighting it won't solve the problem, if it dies down now....it will spring up again in the future.

Football is greater than these clubs. I know that they are at the top but we gotta stand against them for making this decision. Destroying this beautiful sport just for greed is so disappointing.

dididada8719,2021-04-19T05:11:47Z,1,I support the Super league cup because it will take football to the highest level. The best 6 from England and so on to make up 20 clubs from various nations. For example the super league can have its cups as well beside just the league. Lets say united chose to play in the super league it can leave behind a first division united in the Barclays Premier league so as the other chosen clubs from other nations. Let the loser clubs play against each other locally and work their way up to making the local league and cup games competetive. The Super league will bring its league and its own cups and those games will be super hot because the best against the best..it spot on..if the big six choses the super league for instance they can be replaced by its first division players already existing...Love this Super League Idea we want to watch real football that brings in billions take the game up noch. love this game..

I really hope fans of the clubs who participate this ""super"" league boycott all their games so these greedy billionaires will see that its not money that rules over football, its the fans!Without the fans you are literally nothing.

By the way, it's not the Big 6's responsibility to look after grassroots soccer in England, it's ultimately the FA's mandate. I vote for the Super League cause it represents progress - The kind of progress that'll motivate the FA to improve. They've relied on the Big 6 to do all their work them, well guess what... Now it's about to get real and they (FA) will get exposed in front of the entire world to see. All the best to the Big 6- as they've worked hard to deserve the honors ✊🏿"

Lets hear from the TV companies, the SKY's, BT's, Bien Sports, ESPN's and other channels worldwide, as if this European Super League does go ahead, it will be these companies monies that there'll be relying on in broadcasting the games, just boycott them. How about movement of players in terms of recruiting, transfers, put an embargo on all the ESL teams from signing players worldwide so they can only buy/sell players from within the ESL.

Probably Barca is also supporting them behind the doors as barca also need huge amount of money to avoid bankruptcy. Arsenal will probably fail to play in Europe for the first time in over 20 yrs if they don't win the europa. They probably have the biggest desire to play in europa in any form next season.  BTW I am an Arsenal fan. This new European competition is a disgrace because it ensure no matter where u finish in the league u will play in Europe top competition. This thing will probably destroy traditional champions league and europa league competition and ultimately destroy football.

aquilarossa5191,2021-04-19T03:57:18Z,0,"Shame on the Glazers. 

MUFC supporter since 1979. Do I need to alter my tattoo to read RIP MUFC 2021? United not playing in the English league and cups is not my MUFC. I would not abandon this club, but it appears this club would abandon us.
Playing Madrid and Barcalona without having to qualify would get old fast. International careers are at risk due the UEFA threat of bans. Academies are at risk due to the clubs likely becoming all about galacticos. 
This is a hostile takeover of top level football and it must be killed off fast. The American banks financing this will roll out the slick PR and win over dopey people, which will mute opposition and perhaps be enough to get it thru. The Super League brand must be dragged thru the mud so it becomes worthless and not viable. 
What can we expect from US patricians that call it soccer huh? Football supporters of the world unite. We have nothing to lose but the soul of our game, or what's left of it at least. let's get it back. I like something like the German model, or even better. Big money can not railroad clubs over there like this. They have a few clubs that still do well in Europe and their league is still rated highly. 

Shame on the Glazers."

If  the ‘super league’ does happen I will never watch the team I love again (LFC) .  The top tier of English football needs to return to the fans and not wealthy foreign businessmen.

The proposal is for it to be the premier European competition to play on the midweek and not replace the national division. It's basically putting a European competition above the Champions league, 5 non-members will be playing at the new premier European competition.

I don't want it but it's not going to get rid of any competition or stop the Premier league or La liga. If UEFA can mess up European competition and it's prestige with the conference league then why not a premier European league like the Super League. It is about money but I'd prefer money in the club's pockets than the thieving UEFA officials.

For the last 15 years and for the next 15 years one can predict with some  certainity which 4-6 teams will win the premier league .. yes it is a  competitive league but only won  a select few.. in the NHL it is hard to predict who will win the cup

reactionfunnyfunny,2021-04-19T01:44:57Z,0,"A lot of people are not mentioning it but this could literally kill football. In say 50 years, lower divisions could lose money making them bankrupt. This could kill the leagues. Could even kill the premier league after say 70 or so years. This means less clubs, less kids being able to move cities to play for their clubs, less people interested in football. Eventually the Super League will die from lack of demand and then the end of football."
danielmunroe1423,2021-04-19T01:44:37Z,0,Rip my beloved man united you greedy money grabbing bastards. You have destroyed our premier league and i hope you all drown in the billions that you will surely make. I hope its worth it.

justpaddyb127,2021-04-19T01:43:44Z,0,"Does anyone not find it a little out of order that theres threats of players not being allowed to play for there country? 
Like whose the real bad guys here? 
I didn't know about the womens football part.
I actually think that side of it is a fantastic idea, get more money into womens football.
The only thing i do not like about the proposed super league is that the 15 clubs are allowed to be in it every year. However, we could treat this tournament as such just an extra tournament but those that take part its simple. your not allowed to take part in the champions league or europa. Oh wait no that means UEFA dont make as much money ... So again tell me who the greedy one is here, the actual football clubs or UEFA ? 
Lets not forget the corruption at the very top from men like Sepp Blatter and michel platini ... 
I am for having a discussion about the idea being brought forward, theres too many assumptions being made that these clubs would just take all this money and not help there local clubs thrive along with them.

People need to chill and actually question them on improving there ideas to fit everyone rather than just dismissing it entirely and threatening them just makes you look weak as fuck!"
arturo435,2021-04-19T01:43:09Z,1,"This is ALL a big bluff for these powerful clubs to get a bigger cut and to have a bigger say in how the Champions will be reformed in the mid 2020s. These clubs know it's too risky to exit the leagues, and the leagues and UEFA and FIFA know it would be an absolute economic disaster to throw away these clubs and players from competition. They'll come to an agreement."

fuad_a7,2021-04-19T01:40:10Z,0,"I'm an Ajax fan, our club literally based around local talent and being notorious for being a European success with small amounts or no money involved in our squad building. Imagine several Legends and coaches who dedicated their lives for football in its purest form, Ferguson, Cruijff, Michels, Clough, Shankly, Paisley, Beckenbauer who revolutionised football not only in Europe but around the world! And people who have no allegiance towards the game come and propose this filth with only their pockets in mind? Unbelievable. I know the highs and lows and when football is at its best and works it's another feeling. 18/19 we knocked out Juve and Real with a 19 year old as our captain! That's insane! 4 UCL's without a shopping spree on Galacticos! Absolutely leaving no regard for the other teams leaving their history to dust and deviating from fans? And then clubs like Tottenham are in there over Nottingham and Celtic and Villa? They just pissed all over anyone and everyone right here."

I see this as a possibility of decentralising football to countries into a kind of “EU” League.
Teams which are good but who’s domestic league are holding them back, say an Ajax can now join this league & have the power to attract players who would rather see it as feeder club (in its current circumstance).

A Franchise in top European cities which can boost club football in those countries which domestic league’s are not up to par e.g in Russia, Hungary or wherever.

I’m willing to bet they’ll set up the league very much like the NFL with Divisions and Conferences, & the owners will elect a commissioner.

I’m happy someone’s stuck it to such out of touch corrupt backdated organisations like UEFA & FIFA, and the old guard are already saying it’s about greed (they should look in the mirror) & get people like “down to earth” Gary Neville & Gary Lineker (mouthpieces) to represent their opinion.

Yes, it’s about money, it’s the money which is being shifted from one set of pockets to another!
This is why the narrative from the mainstream is so negative, Sky, BBC it’s because along with other bent institutions they’ll be the ones getting screwed.

It’s time for the establishment to lose some more control."
keyboarddancers7751,2021-04-19T01:15:18Z,0,"Top flight football has been a grotesque expression of the most extreme and unrelenting greed for more than 20 years with the biggest clubs wallowing like bloated hippos in truly unimaginable mountains of cash from Arab sheiks, Russian oligarchs and American robber barons such that dozens of *individual players* have each been earning more than the whole budget of entire lower leagues.
People have been writing academic papers for years predicting various scenarios which could ultimately lead football into some sort of economic or structural maelstrom because of the present spectacularly unequal system.
The proposed ESL is *merely* an inevitable and ruthless refinement of most of the existing European premier leagues.

I don't believe the players and managers really want to lose their professional status in the domestic and international arena but can they simply walk away from their massively lucrative contracts underwritten by those insatiable club owners?
Covid: ""Thank goodness the lockdown nightmare is coming to an end and things can get back to normal soon"".

How much does it cost a working class fan spend for a season ticket or paying various subscriptions. It costs a fortune.  It's all well and good about talking big clubs ... greed... all .... How long did it take  EPL to support clubs in lower league  during these COVID time. They almost left them dry.  Wherever money is involved , greed is almost inevitable.  Revamp the champions league to make it more exciting (group stages are too boring baring exceptions), cut the middle man out (European association or whatever they are called as) , introduce salary caps as wages are the biggest expenditure for all these top clubs ( paying someone even if it is Lionel Messi - 600,000 K per week just doesn't seem right). This will make top clubs more profitable and their appetite to look at ways for making money will reduce overtime.

It’s not news for anyone to say that football is no longer driven by popular demand. And it’s definitely not the by fault from the viewers or the fans. They, who have been in charge of these so called none profits gave away the most popular sports on the fucking earth to a beast called capitalism, and now, when the beast realized he has power, the same people who have been ruining the game for years have the nerve to say that they’re actually ""defending football"" ... I mean what the fuck ? 
Go back and look for the corruption casses made against Fifa in the last two decades. You could write volumes for fucks sake !
Corruption everywhere, take a look at Qatar 22 world cup, it stinks of dark money, and people are actually dead for those mishandlings, just like there were people dead in russia. 
It’s a shame that players are still playing under their banners. 
I mean I recognize that this is a sad day for football, but I am allowed to find joy in it if I want. I really find satisfaction in watching them getting destroyed by what they have created. To quote a good lad : ""Gives me more relief than a thousand lying whores."""

aaronreyes6081,2021-04-19T00:56:13Z,0,"You are being too narrow minded when you say ""fans"" and only think of matchday supporters in England. These clubs have MASSIVE fanbases 3 and 4 TIMES the size of the British fans that support them. If they lose English support, others will take their place INTERNATIONALLY. I am a United fan not based in England and I am FULLY against the ESL, its BS. However, the money they will gain from breaking away and catering more to an International audience will ECLIPSE what they currently earn. Aren't the quotes currently at €3.5bn per club that joins? Crazy money, greedy owners, Glazers and all the others OUT."
eltonkingsley5617,2021-04-19T00:56:07Z,1,"I don’t remember being a consulted fan when UEFA made themselves the commercial owner of the Champions League. Perhaps if UEFA has stuck to their original mission of European regulator instead of chief revenue overlord, then perhaps there would be no need for a breakaway rival competitor. Is it the clubs being greedy, or UEFA by keeping the lions share of commercial gains."
nox1304,2021-04-19T00:55:51Z,0,"Football has sadly become a commodity. A commodity that has to be profitable, no matter how football fans may feel.  And given the fact that most of the big european clubs are being run by non-Europeans and have  millions of fans living outside Europe, it was only a matter of time before they succumbed to the demands of the international comsumer and foreign capital. So from a commercial point view, a European Super League will most certainly look ideal. But there can be no doudt that such an action will put a tombstone to football as the game we all loved, the game of the community, the game that represented equality in action, the game that for every fan (big or small, rich or poor, passionate or distant) symbolized much more than just pure entertainment. The emotional connection between a fan and his team (the very emotional connection that attracted the capitalists' attention) will be severely damaged, if such plans materialize. The national championships will demise and football could be officially turned into a sport controlled by the few. 
And I am little bit skeptical about all this money that circulates all over the football market in the last years. Can it all be sustainable or is football becoming another big financial bubble ready to burst and this ""European Super League"" is the big clubs' desperate effort to get a bail-out? I am not an expert in finance, but all these huge amounts of money being so lightheartedly spent on transfers, bonuses and agents' fees worry me a lot."

For me, as a fan, i think super league will be more interesting because all the heavyweights are destined to play each other every season. How interesting that will be. Also, EPL will still go on as always, its just that there is another league at the european level, which is Super League. The EUFA are FREE to continue their Champions league, just dont expect the big 6 to take part in it.

johnlyons2257,2021-04-19T00:53:04Z,0,"These 12 football clubs want to make the deals directly with the TV companies rather than it being done by UEFA. UEFA is now seen as a middle man that the clubs don't need. This will happen, and soon I believe there will be an ESL 2 with promotion and relegation. Once this happens in Europe it's almost inevitable that it will happen domestically. Clubs and their money will oust the FA. It's not too Sci-fi to imagine a game where the clubs involved come to their own specific deal for any particular match. Wouldn't most fans ultimately want their own club to have more control over their clubs business, rather than being dictated to by the high council of the old blazer brigade? Just wondering."
petershortland478,2021-04-19T00:52:59Z,0,"Joe Glazer wouldn't even know half of the clubs in grassroots football should be about seeing clubs from lower end of Pyramid to come to our stadium and in reverse ie Arsenal they came to Sutton United and Sutton did very very well and after the game Arsenal donated their bit of the door money and also bit more due to FA taking a portion.

The way the Glazers have run United has not made me proud to be a United fan because of how it has been managed.

But today they broke my heart and hearts of millions of fans all around the world. Today, it was made sure that another miracle at Leicester never happens again. Today, the underdog died. Today, hope died. Today, greed won."

We are used to immoral cash-grabs from our politicians. In fact, there is a scandal about it right now going on in the UK. But I always - somewhat naively - thought football would be shielded from this.

Are there no limits to the desire for money?

Does greed trump everything else?

Can't remember if the winner of the cup was allowed for the next year... but thats beside the point . I wish all fans just never watch that thing and focus on their own country and local teams."

The Kronke’s are in this for the money only and they could not care less about the club and the fans! Since they took over and invested £0 Arsenal are going down hill fast! With them in charge the last few seasons in the CL were miserable. Arsenal getting drubbed by the likes of Bayern and Barca! This Super League will have Arsenal at the bottom of it! There’s no relegation so that’s ok for the poisonous owners who fired of the staff last season and furlowed many more! Makes you sick! Kronke out!"

tonimaccaroni7297,2021-04-19T00:39:17Z,14,"Since i first watched a match of Real Madrid, this club caught me. The way their players played the game was not comparable to any other teams. They were true winners, real champions with exceptional talent and a strong mind. I loved to see them play every week, every clasico i watched i sat there in the white shirt, hoping that cristiano, figo, benzema would score and insulting those barcelona players like pique, puyol and messi. I really loved this club.

I am shattered and it truly breaks my heart to see that Florentino Perez is about to destroy our sport as a first chairman. The time, the passion and the love i offered to this club all feel wasted."

jakobs7307,2021-04-19T00:33:21Z,0,"I think it's important everyone realize this isn't a bluff or a publicity stunt to get more money out of UEFA.  This is the owners of the biggest clubs in the world making their play at turning European and eventually world football into something more akin to an American sports league.  

If FIFA and UEFA won't play ball they will continue to start ""their own"" tournaments.  Won't let out players in the World Cup?  We'll start our own.  Won't let us in the domestic league?  We'll start our own.  They WILL be taking in big money from sponsorships and TV deals and will be shelling out the biggest contracts, once they start their own international tournaments they'll allow their players to play in them.  Then you get to play with your country and make the most money.  Players will participate.  

It won't come to that though, FIFA and UEFA will cave.  This is the biggest clubs in world football putting their cards on the table and telling the governing bodies if they don't decentralize their power and hand it over to the owners like the leagues in America are set up then they will destroy them."

Probably sick of it, clubs trying to pull more power back."

stevendchu,2021-04-19T00:29:13Z,1,"As a Canadian, I'm here to offer some perspective seeing how everyone is talking about football being ""Americanized"". This new supershitleague is NOTHING like North American pro sports. Here, we have draft picks for teams that finish near the bottom. Yes ok you can say that's rewarding failure, but it also helps keep things competitive. Same with salary caps, they make it fair. Other than the NBA, if you spend wisely, draft well and have a good strategy your team is only 2-3 years away from being contenders. This will NEVER HAPPEN in this new league. Spurs & Arsenal are signing up to be punching bags, they cannot compete with City or Real. The worse thing is they won't EVEN TRY now.

As a Man City fan, I will never ever going to agree with the European Super League. It will damage football forever. These clubs like Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Juventus which they're highly interested in this 'breakaway' league are there for greed. They are not thinking about the fans. They are not thinking about the legacy of the club. They building this because of jealousy of the Premier League that is getting more and more popular season by season. They needed the 'Big 6' Premier League clubs to help them invest in this new and absurd project. If that is the case then how is it going to work out? They will not going to play at their own stadiums. Is the Bernabéu and Camp Nou will be a waste of space? I just don't want the beauty of football go to waste by a group of arrogant, self-centered, and selfish people that don't care about the stability of the fans and the community as well. Ever since this Super League started, the players of these 12 clubs will not compete in their national teams because of the breakaway league.

Now if all 6 English clubs do opt-out of the Super League then Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Juventus will be on trial and if UEFA wins the legal war those 3 clubs will be getting a financial fine or a worse 10 point deduction of their respective leagues with La Liga and Serie A. 

Now I'm glad that PSG, Bayern Munich, and Dortmund did not want and never be a part of any this at first and they'll continue to be part of UEFA and all of their domestic system. Which they've shown how passionate and comprehensive they are towards fans and also they have a good reputation as well.

 If Man City agrees to this I will not support them. I will support like clubs like West Ham, Aston Villa, or Brighton which they're clubs in the humble beginnings, built by fan supporters. As much as I love City with all my blue heart, if it happens, I will not be a fan of them. Please Sheikh Mansoor and Khaldoon Al-Mubarak do not ruin Man City.

The people behind the idea of the “Super League” is Florentino Pérez and Real Madrid.

Where did Florentino Pérez find inspiration for this League?  Real Madrid were the ones with the idea for the Champion’s League and the World Cup.  Today  they are just doing it again. 

Why are they doing it? They are doing it because of the cemented corruption that has taken hold of FIFA, UEFA and the rest.  Football is dying, it is getting more expensive for the fans. it has to adapt and overcome."

The proof of this are the expanded UCL and FIFA Club World Cup formats and UEFA announcing potential finals in the Middle East and the United States. In my view, if not the Super League, at the least I believe these clubs need more of a co-op between themselves for continental play.

perfectgogeta,2023-12-21T16:37:01Z,5,We all want the super league to come. We are tired of UEFA.
Delboy0,2023-12-21T16:32:34Z,4,"The Super League was only serious thing when the English Premier League were involved. It is now illegal for English teams to join the Super League and fans have made it clear they do not want Premier League clubs in a Super League. 

A Super League without English teams is worth nothing, because Italian, Spanish, German and French clubs don’t drive global viewership anywhere near the level of English teams, so they will not get top tier TV contracts for a league with no English teams. 

I get why Real Madrid and Barcelona want it because they see the writing on the wall. They both will be bankrupt in 20 years because they overspend on wages while the La Liga contract is shrinking in value. They literally have to win the champions league every year to break even. The Super League is the only thing that can save them financially, but they will not get the money they expect without English teams."

Spoke nothing of substance other than advertising for Barcelona/Real Madrid. No one told Barcelona to schedule a friendly in the US midweek of their league schedule with all the injuries they have. Go listen to his similar discussion with Henry, Carragher and Micah . I'm glad those guys pushed back about PL plucking all the top talent and pointing out how Barcelona/Real Madrid did the same thing back in the early 2000s. This is nothing more than Barcelona trying to make up for their own financial fails. You can have a legitimate gripe with UEFA over additional tournaments like Nations League, expanding club world cup, too many international matches, etc. But the fans already have spoken back in 2021. Germany's league model is the complete opposite of ESL. When fans in England speak, PL listens."

And when asked about games bot being played in Europe amd instead in the US he says ""why not?"" Well if you're going to make a show on football at least bring someone who understands the true magic of football the fact that even if you're a small team from a coner of Europe you'll still get to see the best teams in the world play in your own stadium if you work hard enough.

toluoyeniyi7262,2023-12-23T11:55:47Z,1,"The most glaring flaw in the Super League concept is the absence of a relegation system. This omission strikes at the very heart of what makes football so captivating and dynamic. The presence of relegation in football adds a layer of suspense and competition, ensuring that every match matters and that teams must consistently perform to stay at the top. This principle of merit-based competition is fundamental to the sport's identity and appeal.

In contrast, if the Premier League had adopted a similar model in 1992, establishing a closed league with permanent members and no relegation, its success and popularity might have been significantly diminished. The integration with the Championship and the fluidity of teams moving between divisions based on performance is a key aspect of English football's charm and success. This system maintains a high level of competitiveness and unpredictability, which is essential for engaging fans and preserving the sport's integrity."

I agree with reworking the competitions but the super league doesn’t acknowledge the  parasocial aspects of a city to its team to that teams identity to their country it negates all that by picking them out of their league and watering down the interest for the domestic leagues. Along with that, it takes the meritocracy out of sports that we all love. The underdog or the black horses would be no more. No more FC Copenhagens or Atalantas, or Villareals fighting for semifinal spots. The super league is only for ultra capitalistic interest and just like capitalism is consuming the world it will swallow football whole and the clubs that are in financial instability that got there because of their own mismanagement will be there again a couple decades down the line hoping another league organizer comes along to sweeten the pot again"

How is that the UK are creating a new law which would prevent competition. I know the UK has anti-monopoly laws as  well. So this would seem to go against that. I'm also aware that the UK is not in the EU anymore. But it seems draconian to enforce something like this.

- if Man City are facing severe punishment from the Premier League, is there a chance they might not care about the threat of being kicked out the league if they can join the Super League

- Whether you are for or against it, you can't rely on Sky or other current sports broadcasters to give you an unbiased take on this. Why? because Sky, the BBC, BeIN, TNT/BT and whoever else have a invested 100s of millions in multi-year broadcasting rights, that should this go through they won't be worth anywhere near the value they paid and under current proposals the Super League will be free to view, which cuts them right out of it. So while I am already against this idea, it is absolutely not surprising in the least that Sky Sports and their experts are up in arms about it."

It does not make sense to me to have a league competition where there is just so much distance in budget and power between the top and the bottom as it happens in domestic leagues. 
Be honest, wouldn't you prefer it too?
So, oh, but that's not fair to Burnley? Burnley can do a great job and keep winning and if they do, they can earn the right to play in the first division of the European [Super] league.
I do not care if they call it European Super League or if UEFA and the leagues restructure their competitions to something that makes sense."

theclown8568,2021-07-28T01:01:03Z,4,"Don't remember Neville, Keane or Richards criticising their club owners when they were paying them 100k a week.
 Didn't ever see Neville or Keane labelling the Glazers 'imposters' or standing with the fans initial anti-Glazer protests when they were receiving pay rises. In fact the Man United players and Fergie were on tv shouting about how great they are and for the fans to trust them.
  Gary Neville is now retired and just realised  how the fans have felt since the day the Glazers bought the Club. 
   If they were all still playing they'd be doing the same as the current players which is keeping their mouth shut as to not hinder their pockets being lined. 
  If Salford City were offered a guaranteed place in a breakaway league with no risk of relegation and a guaranteed annual payment that would remove risk, significantly improve revenue and cement a healthy return on investment then Gary would have dropped his microphone and be on his way to Salford to sign the contract immediately.

Gary Neville and active players like Kevin De bruyne should reduce their salaries and fight for a more affordable football because this sport is not affordable for everybody if they are supporting ""the people's game""."

Because this comparison wont be accurate. Thats why we have the 50+1 rule in germany. The 50+1 rule is not perfect but it ensures germany to have the 93% degree of capacity in the stadiums. Nearly Everybody has her or his club. We habe clubs in the 3rd !!!League with more Fans than an average NBA club (Like 1.Fc Kaiserslautern, Dynamo Dresden or MSV Duisburg have way more Fans than the Indiana Pacers, the Sacramento Kings, or Memphis Grizzlies) When corona is over, please come over here and see like 1.Fc Köln against Borussia mönchengladbach or Werder Bremen agains Hamburger SV or VfB Stuttgart against SC Freiburg.

The 90s, getting worse and worst year on year 

Now all hell is let loose with this super league 

These so called greedy men who run football clubs, just saw how football changes over the years and now they want to take advantage, do you blame them as no one has opposed this greed in the past 

But now it’s not ok

Let’s summarise key moments in football that turned the game in a money grabbing industry 

Establishment of the premier league back in 1992, they broke away from the football league due to lucrative television broadcasting money,

But hang on, this money was only for the elite teams in uk, 

What happened to the lower clubs 🤔

Why no one opposed this back then🤔

Rising prices of football kits and season tickets 
Football is the heart of the community you say 🤔
Why has the prices of football kits and season tickets gone so high in recent years 
I won’t be surprised a pair of football socks will cost £100 any time soon,
Don’t worry we won’t complain 

Rich owners buying clubs and spending millions on who ever they want to buy from
All over the world 

What happens to the youth players and home grown talent from the uk, they will get a chance to play for their club they love

We say football is for the people
And for the community 

We can’t pick and choose, 

Hopefully this so called super league which get people seeing the ugly side of football 

Who knows 
Maybe one day a we see clubs slashing prices of football kits so everyone in the community can be able to afford one"

The fans don’t own the clubs - they support them. Buy tickets and merchandise. Do you think you own your local pub because you have a pint in there.
51% for the fans, which fans will be able to afford the shares - those with lots of spare cash probably. I hope it’s not the way?
Like in Germany? Their league is shite, the six teams never said anything about leaving the premier league, all the pressure put on by the current syndicates to ensure their giant cash cow isn’t moved, FIFA, UEFA, Premier League, SKY. 
Never seen so much bullshit propaganda, The Conservatives and Boris Johnson were calling out the footballers wages about Covid last year, no comments about millionaire racing drivers or tennis players, The Royals, come on... 
I don’t believe any high profile football team is set up as a benevolent fund for needy fans."

True but none of you rise the voice against the Glazers, Abramovich, Sheik Mubarak or Fenway Sports club when they do not care about the supporters and football clubs are just a way to get power and to ear money. So yes, Pure Greed, but you also need to include those rich people behind the clubs. At least Real Madrid and Barcelona belong to their supporters. Florentino Perez is not the owner, just the elected president of the club. So, stop the hypocrisy. Your club, Manchester United was ""bought"" by the Glazers with Manchester United's money itself, they did not put a penny in that purchase. and you took the money from them when you played for the Red Devils, Gary."
daverichardson6320,2021-04-23T09:23:36Z,0,"For me, what the ESL forgot was that football is not the NFL. Every club that competes in the Premiership, the Championship and Leagues 1 & 2 beyond have over 100 years of history behind them. And with that history comes rivalry and competition and shared memories. As a Manchester United fan, the interesting games are not just about City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal, they are about Leeds, they are about Nottingham Forest, they are about Aston Villa, they are about Celtic and Derby County, all the teams that we have faced in the past because we share that history. And you cannot erase that and tie us in to the biggest clubs in Europe, because the football story isn't only about the top 20 clubs in Europe, it's about every club that caused an upset and beat us when we expected to win. So power to the Leicesters, the Shef Wednesday's, the Stockport Counties, because even though you might not be as rich as Man Utd, because your trophy room is not as full, your history and your place in the football community is just as valuable and any true fan would look forward to playing you as much as we would face Rea Madrid or Barcelona."

ArachnidSoul,2021-04-23T08:48:06Z,1,"So if FIFA just let this Super League continue without putting sanctions on the teams... those same teams would carry out their usual schedules. FIFA is telling the teams if they participate in the Super League, you are barred from the traditional leagues. These clubs are not the problem. The problem is FIFA. These teams had no plans of letting their fans down, or not playing their usual schedule. This is FIFA punishing the fans, and trying to get the fans to be mad at the clubs. Truth is, keeping the scheduled games, as well as the Super League games, would mean more games for the same fans. If they kill the Super League this year, it will be back. When it comes back, it will be that much more along. It's like how unions get started."

aakashsuryi9098,2021-04-23T06:23:57Z,0,"The clubs are directly responsible for the situation they're in. 
It's them who've allowed player wages to sky-rocket. 
It's them who've allowed transfer fees to sky rocket. 
Most of them have no Financial Discipline or Diligence. 
How are players allowed to earn 300,000€\\£ every week as direct Salary?!? Regardless of whether they play good or bad?!?? How?!? In what world is that ok?!? Bear in mind I'm not talking about Messi/Ronaldo/Suarez here. 
We as fans need to have this conversation because it's the elephant in the room. 
Let's consider Liverpool as an example simply because they have players who ""arguably"" have had the highest work-rate/output in the last 3/4 years under Klopp in terms of distance run per game and other statistics. 
Who in Liverpool gets paid above 250k directly as Salary? Only VvD and Salah. 
The rest them earn very reasonably when compared to other clubs. There was a study done on this comparing the salaries of players at different clubs. 
Imo, Liverpool is one of the most financially disciplined clubs in Europe. Let's put aside the fact that Jon Henry was one of the main party to initiate this ESL. 


The rising Players Wages and Salaries is the main underlying issue that's at heart of this ESL that nobody wants to address. 
Cristiano makes about 100 million because of sponsorships every year. Who decided to give Messi 500 million as a direct component of Salary?!? Who was the donkey who made this decision?!?? Now that Barca is in fukin Debt they are planning to monopolize the competition along with other Idiots. 
Believe me as football fans (not club fans) this is a conversation that NEEDS to be had. Players need to be paid a fixed component of Salary, and a Variable Bonus Component based on their performance output ( Goals, Saves, Clean Sheets, Assists, Pre-Assists, Chances/Opportunities Created, Key Passes, etc) 
This Conversation needs to be had sooner or later. 
Those fuking owners and executives are fuking incompetent who dress up in fancy suits. 

Dortmund, Liverpool, Leister, Athletico Madrid are some of the most Financially Disciplined and Well -run clubs. 
You don't have divas & Super-models like Neymar, Pogba, Ozil, etc. 
I'm not even going to address Rmadrid and Barca because they're a disaster. 
That Bartameo idiot gave Messi half a Billion as Direct Salary."
tedvandekamp6432,2021-04-23T06:18:01Z,1,"The actual greed within the world of football is not with the clubowners but with the players and their management.

I only saw him once on the pitch in Prague, when he was screaming his head off at Ronaldo for missing a sitter and poncing around. He's helped to kick this sick charade into touch, kudos Gary! But, his other comment about complicity in this situation here Sky holds water. This all started when the FA decided to let Nation States purchase clubs. It has always been about $ (not going to change either) but the situation escalated out of control in the UK back in the 90s/00s. Don't slag off the American sports, NFL, MLB and NBA are not the same animal as football - there is another exploitative feeder system (university leagues). The salary cap idea is a good one for football - has been ignored and this is what you get, clubs overpaid, took on way to much debt, now being rescued by Governments (?).

cyberxtrem2581,2021-04-21T22:34:38Z,2,"Hey I am a Real Madrid fan, I think everyone of us all also agree that the UEFA&FIFA are a mafia, there is no transparency, we don't know their salaries,  there are no rules on such big decisions like where to play the World Cup, they probably elected Qatar because received a bunch of money that we don't even know.

In this current moment the clubs are having a veery bad time and it makes a LOT of sense for them to take control and do the changes for the business to keep running the best possible way and to give the fans around the world what they want. 

And it is not true that there is no meritocracy. Yep, the founder ones are guaranteed to play but also there would have been other ones elected by meritocracy, and of course the winner of the SuperLeague have to beat the current top clubs in the world which are the usual ones in the final stages of the Champions League.

But there is major point for what I am against it,  that Real Madrid would stop winning more Champions Leagues, 13 is still not enough!! ;) 

Have a nice day guys!

PS: Edited to make my point more clear about the UEFA and FIFA being part of the same opaque structure which almost everyone of us consider them a mafia."

Banks are greedy and they don't like to play games where they lose money. This competition it this exactly. Man U and 11 others get a Founding Partners pass and can cash in every season. The Founding Partners can never be removed from the competition unlike the 8 others who would rotate in and out based on performance. 
The is just a way of putting on a show and syphoning money out of the mindless fans."

If media corporations back down => clubs don't get their free billions

To many times soccer isn’t interesting or exciting to watch when it comes to the club league’s over the past years. I believe a change like this will be a major step into the right direction long term its just hard initially to accept these changes that could effect the history of this sport. But something has to be done let’s all be honest soccer competition has been at its lowest they need to make the game exciting for all of us to watch and that’s the real truth to all this!!

It's a neat idea to think that, in principle, an American city like Madison or Topeka could rise through the ranks to win a top-league cup. The ""closed league"" IS elitist. Sure, I can understand owners wanting to make as much money as they can. But sometimes businesspeople have to think a bit bigger. Grow the game... expand the markets... bring in more fans.

That's why we are withdrawing from ESL"". Like, b*tch please! Really? We all see what you have done there! You all have shown your true face! Even if there hadn't been any protests, you should have known it's a mistake to begin with. Oh sorry, my bad. I forgot that one needs to have conscience to be able to figure it out. How stupid of me to expect club owners to have one. It's one of those things that can't be bought or leased. Apart from their money they have nothing. I used to be a Man United fan and I sort of lost interest when SIr Alex Ferguson quit. What Gary Neville says here is what I loved about the good old Man United. They've lost it and so have many other clubs too. I still remember times when clubs used to play multiple seasons wearing the same outfit. Today they release a new design every single year, just to generate revenue from the merch. I still remember how disgusted I was when I saw Juventus' new logo 3 years ago. It was then when I realized ""Ok. it's not Juventus FC but Juventus & sons limited"". I am planning to go on a roadtrip to Italy and visit Turin and Milan and I was willing to buy myself something small from their football stores, as a keepsake. I think I won't do it now. Mr Agnelli and the rest of the Dirty Dozen will never get a cent from me. Yes, they will survive without my ongoing support but I will die a happier person, knowing I haven't supported criminals."

TristanWeijermars,2021-04-21T10:12:49Z,0,"Yes, I am also disgusted by the plans of those richest clubs. But the idea that now football is dead is strange. The Champions League already took care of that more than twenty years ago. When was the last time we had a surprise winner, or even finalist, in that competition? How many times did we have a final that didn't have any of the teams in it that now want to break apart? Isn't it already normal that the richest clubs take the prizes every year? To me European football lost its attraction a long time ago, and only occasionally I look up some games: when we see surprises. So let those clubs have their Super League. Let them step out of the Champions League and fight it out among themselves. Then finally we might see some interesting (unpredictable!) tournaments. I am only wondering how long the fans of the Super League clubs will stay interested when all they see is the same opponents year after year."

There is the club Bayern Munich e.V. (all amateurs, lower leagues and youth leagues are organized in it) and the company FC Bayern Munich AG, which employs all licensed players who take part in the Bundesliga and the Champions League.

And here it comes:
FC Bayern München e.V. is the main shareholder of FC Bayern München AG and holds 75% of the shares.
The remaining shares (8.33 percent each) are held by long-standing Bayern-Munich partners Adidas, Audi and Allianz.

The cost for each game is atrocious, I dont hear you speaking up about that?  Not everyone can afford season tickets and Sky have capitalised fully on that, in the past 20 years the prices your employer  charges UK fans for viewing the beautiful game is disgraceful.

Again, agree 100% the ESL is about greed, but so is SKY.  Comes across a bit hypocritical.  I dont think we need to talk about footballers wages do we?

If the UEFA/FIFA can mannage this there would be a lot of trouble gone, because thats whats this all about. An example, here in Holland not any person in the public sector can earn more money then the prime-minister. The salarys in soccer are insane! Discus whats reasonable what a average club like AC Milan can pay and then to that for all the European competitions so the best players won't go anymore to the club who offers you the most money, period!"

That doesn't exist in the USA because no matter if a team loses and ends last, they will play again next year with no consequences. Apathy. Sports is entertainment in the USA, but in the rest of the world, sports is a passion and almost a religion, a commitment of a society for the love of a sport."

sdfkjguytdy1646,2021-04-21T01:49:57Z,0,"CCP Deep Involvement in Organ Harvesting
The CCP has been heavily involved in forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience. This practice has lasted for over 10 years, yet the CCP has been denying it.

MP Sinčić said that among all transplant surgeries in the world, two-thirds of the patients went to China for surgery. In Croatia, for example, one has to wait many years for an organ transplant. In China, the wait time is much shorter and is often only days. It is unlikely that the CCP does not know the significance of this discrepancy. In fact, the regime has been actively participating in the forced organ harvesting, although it keeps lying about it at the same time. In the end, organ harvesting has become a tool for the CCP to eliminate political dissidents and to make huge profits. 

Sinčić said that when he first learned about the CCP's forced organ harvesting several years ago, as a human being, he was very angry. He also felt bad because hardly any high officials in the international community had taken action to stop this. 

Joint Efforts Required
Sinčić remarked that it is good that in 2021, more and more attention has been paid to the CCP's forced organ harvesting. This means that more people have heard about it and more conferences have been held to discuss the issue. 

Stopping the crime also requires joint efforts from different countries. As a MEP, Sinčić said that the European Union had not openly criticized the CCP due to concerns over business relations with China. He said that this needs to end and that people’s lives should be placed in the highest priority. He stressed that it is time to stop the fear of the CCP, so that the European Union and the world in general will take a position against the regime. 

Some foreign companies have also benefited from the organ harvesting and organ trade, including companies from Europe, the United States, and other Asian countries. Furthermore, many global businesses are also connected to the forced labor system in China. 

Sinčić proposed to investigate the firms involved, followed by sanctions against those businesses as well as individuals. He said that now is the time for the international community to say no to the forced organ harvesting in China."

lox9973,2021-04-21T01:31:09Z,1,"Please read this post carefully ;

Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .

The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .

Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . 
Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..

Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; 

Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) . 

Do these things, and you will be saved .

If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife . 

You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true .

Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );

‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ ."

This is the global corporate greedy fucks, just thinking of other ways again, of how to steal the wealth and heart from the communities who made this game.  Since they get involved, the game is becoming more about how much money can we make.  Yes, penalise these clubs heavy.  Knock points off them.  No way will the fans stand for this, nor the players.  Clubs should be owned by the fans."

Capitalism must be stopped when it tries to take possession of our collective cultural inheritance. Our inheritance is ours not theirs. And it's not for sale. We'll said Gary. The nation agrees with you and we will not tolerate this. Our inheritance will not be stolen by outsiders. We will take a stand against this cultural theft..

As a Chelsea fan of 55 years despair what owner has done and is doing  ! It is not a rich kids plaything but club goes back before he was born

justanotherguy5590,2021-04-20T19:35:49Z,0,"IN CONCACAF, with MLS there was a 'SuperLiga'.  It was something like 5 MLS and 5 FMF clubs competing.  Totally different in that the stature of the leagues are obviously different than UEFA clubs, let alone the elite.  But the point I make is after 2 years of it, the interest and novelty was gone.  Totally.  I think the same interest would be gone as well here.  There are ways to upgrade and make the UCL better and more engaging.  The breakaway wreaks of the kind of franchise mentality that reminds you no matter how often MLS teams try to call themselves 'FC - Pick A City'', they are still Franchises.  They will move and rebrand.  And those are the types of owners that infiltrated Europe."

Players earning 250k a week are now the face of the premier league and their respective club but don’t perform any different from a player in the same position in a mid table team...but that player has a fan base from a good season they had 2 years ago so they take centre stage over a better player.

Do you think they'd make more money? Will the fans used to beating weak clubs 5: 0 and generally winning most of the time, be willing to stomach getting  beaten by Barcelona or Real week by week?

These oligarchs are sucking our individual nations dry, they've destroyed capitalism with their rigged form of corporatism. 

Its not the free market when oligarchs can rigg our economies and governments and media against us all. They get bailouts, tax breaks, every ten years and the rest of us are left to fail. These oligarchs aren't just screwing us with football, they are screwing us on every level. Globally. 

Time for people to wake up. Working class people are the majority and we are NOT being represented, in government, in media, nowhere. Were all being laughed at by these mega wealthy elites. They have trippled their wealth during Covid whilst we peasants are forced to lose our jobs and lose our lives.

Just wait until King Bezos has some AI. Amazon is an economy in its own right, Bezos will create an army of AI inevitably. Now is our last chance to tell these people to go suck on rocks before they push us all into some dystopian nightmare version of corporate feudalism.

People warned of 'one world governments' and have totally ignored these massive corporations and billionaires. They are destroying our economies with their greed. We will all be ruled by one corporation, we will be jobless and these oligarchs will destroy our social safety nets and democracies, essentially leaving us working classes to starve out, globally.

Those are words nothing but words.. there is wisdom that is saying: ""If you don't know how to fight the world, then save the world from your noise"". Don't bust people in this fight between your foundations ""FIFA, UEFA, against the 12clubs.. 
I don't buy words like football for humanity and all that etc.., because FIFA and UEFA are against humanity and against democracy from the beginning.. 
First and last question? How many poor people that can watch games for free? Also us are we watching games for free ????.?????? So FIFA and UEFA there talk got to be based on facts or they can stop talking rather than to disrespect those 12 teams and reason why they are against it's only only because all the credit of the SuperLeague will go from A-Z to the clubs not FIFA either UEFA. so (mr. FIFA) and (mr.UEFA) got to stop throwing People's names and poor and all that disgusting noisey words talk with respect and fact, or don't talk at all.
Now football becomes valuable when you know that your unfair and opaque interests will collapse.
I can only say to Florentino Perez, thank you.
Thank you for wanting to end the monopoly.
Thanks for showing the minerals of these.
Thank you for being an independent institution.
Thanks for not mishandling the manners as they did.

It's just a challenge to the current powers that be and status quo. In military terms, an affect display. Now they got everyone reeling.  

I'm indifferent right now.

It could mean more money, more football, more opportunities for players and teams.

Neville is just a noisy can. His suggestions are preposterous. His hatred of Liverpool gushed. Why did he come that far against us? Is he that daft? Did any tell him all this is a Liverpool agenda? Even if it is, so bl$$dy f@cking what? Give the dummy manc a cold beer."
blackjetski555,2021-04-20T16:59:30Z,0,"In the short term we obviously need to stop this from happening, but in the long term we need to seriously look at the way things have changed over the last 28 years, that led to these greedy owners and investors feeling emboldened to attempt something as ludicrous and disgraceful as this.

TV money and rights are being flooded into the game at an alarming rate, and there have been many changes to european competitions by stealth e.g. more champions league places for the main European associations ensuring the big names are there every year. And making the CL more skewed towards a big round robin format (like the proposed 2024 changes), ensuring smaller clubs don't make it to the later rounds. The fans, players, staff, national associations, press, politicians... we've all, as european nations, been relatively accepting of these changes, and like it or not, these changes have given those shameful owners and JPMorgan Chase the platform to pull this off.

The question is, how do you convince 100s of millions of football fans across the world not to watch games like Barcelona v Liverpool or Real Madrid v Man City on a regular basis? The gradual elitism and monopolisation has led to a couple of dozen 'must-see' games because several teams have swooped the world class players between them. So are we now too entrenched in a franchise era to break? Because as long as we are, the super league attempts (first one was in 1998) will never go away."

bartvandeperck90,2021-04-20T14:58:29Z,2,"I understand GN's emotional reaction but a lot of it unfornatunately has to be discarted or at least nuanced.

What sanctions can the PL really enforce? The teams that are leaving are not going to pay fines to an institution they no longer belong to. They won't care about point reduction or relegation if they won't be playing in the league next year. Just like they won't care about Chgampions Leagues or World cups. They'll create their own because they realiaze they are the main attraction.

Furthermore, the fact that the entire pyramid system is about to collapse because of 6 teams clearly shows what the problem is. 6 teams were carrying an entire football system. Teams funded by billionaires and investment groups that care about business first and football second. Billionaires and investment groups that the PL allowed to buy their way in because it brought business and money to the PL. 
It's a pretty despicable move by the big clubs but let's not ignore the causes of this problem. If the PL (and all other big leagues) had been a fair and uncorrupted system, this might not have happend.

Simply demonizing the big clubs and calling the PL the victim isn't the complete picture. Fans and clubs that are left behind are the victims, not the football system itself. Whatching the UEFA president talking about sanctions is complete irony. He's just realizing his greedy organisation is about to lose its nr 1 position to a new greedy system."

dramastudiobordeaux8058,2021-04-20T14:12:20Z,0,"FA allowing billionaires to buy the top clubs years ago was the beginning of this. This move is a natural next step for the billionaire owners. Why is anyone surprised? Its all about money, not the beautiful game. The game has been commodified. Its about profit. nothing else matters. Neoliberalism. 

Player salaries are at the heart of the problem. Players paid too much - bankrupting clubs and creating a two tier system. 
There is sooooo much money in the game yet the clubs are near bankrupt. Barcelona has debts of over ONE Billion Euro. Its not sustainable. Either the people take back control of the game or it will continue down this road of ruin.

Whats happening in football is mirrored in the greater society. 

How, in this day and age, where 14m people in the UK are living in poverty. 1 in 4 children go to school hungry (thank you Rashford for calling this out), that a young man gets paid 100k plus to kick a ball around a pitch? How is that sustainable from a business model standpoint and from a moral standpoint? 
While Nurses and front line staff are risking their lives to control this pandemic and the gov't gives them an effective pay cut. Some nurses have to use food banks. 
Is this how we want to organise society? Neoliberalism? Or do we want something better? 

A question for both football and wider society."

STATEMENT Bayern Munich (20.04.2021)
""FC Bayern München has a clear stance on the issue of the Super League. “Our members and fans reject a Super League,” said president Herbert Hainer. “As FC Bayern, it is our wish and our aim that European clubs live the wonderful and emotional competition that is the Champions League, and develop it together with UEFA. FC Bayern SAYS NO to the Super League.”

CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge reinforced that: “On behalf of the board, I would like to make it explicitly clear that FC Bayern will not be taking part in the Super League. FC Bayern stands in SOLIDARITY with the Bundesliga. It always was and is a great pleasure for us to be able to play and represent Germany in the Champions League. We all remember fondly our 2020 Champions League victory in Lisbon – you don’t forget such a joyful moment. For FC Bayern, the Champions League is the best club competition in the world.”



STATEMENT Borussia Dortmund (20.04.2021)
Borussia Dortmund chief executive officer Hans Joachim Watzke gave a statement on Monday morning regarding the discussion of the establishment of a European Super League.

''The board members of the European Club Association (ECA) came together for a virtual meeting on Sunday evening, where it was agreed that the board's decision from last Friday still stands,'' said Watzke, going on to add: ''This decision dictates that all clubs wish to implement the proposed reforms to the UEFA Champions League. The ECA board members took a clear stance in rejecting plans for the establishment of a Super League.''

Watzke also stressed that ''both German clubs on the ECA board, FC Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, shared exactly the same stance throughout all discussions.''"

jeremiasmartinez5237,2021-04-20T14:05:59Z,1,"It's crazy to see how so many people with authority are giving their opinion without being informed first. The only argument you see against the league are just populist claims of rich-poor.
1st, is false that only the founders will play. Some good teams that have a great performance in the local league can get to the Superleague the same way they got to the Champions. It is true that a random team from Ireland won't do it, but that makes sense because nobody watches that matches.
The truth is that the upcoming generation is raised by extreme dopamine provided by apps like tik tok and almost nobody sits and watches a 2hr long match of random teams. This is a way to make people way more interested in the sport, because the audience in the Champions was decreasing a lot over this years.
There can be a redistribution of the money made by big clubs and that will help all football together. 
Is fine if anybody is still against it, but you have to inform yourself and give real arguments, not populist ones."

itchyscratchie5399,2021-04-20T13:25:00Z,0,"I'm an irishman and I'm going to instruct you on how to stop this with a series of particular protests.   If you are serious about stopping this at all.  
1..... first I want every football fan from every club and league to type an email explaining your rejection of this proposal in the best words you can and email it to the official email of the clubs involved. 
2.... I want every football fan of the clubs involved to call up their clubs and cancel their season ticket and demand a refund. 
3..... I want every football fan of the clubs involved to remove themselves from all official members sites and platforms relating to the clubs.  
4.....this one is a little bit radical but its a means to an end. I want every football fan who contributes to charities on a regular basis sponsored by the official clubs involved to cancel their donations and subscriptions.  These can be reinstated when the issue is resolved. 

There are more protest steps to be taken and I will explain these when necessary.  
If you truly want to stop this new super league you will do as I say.  If you do we will be on the road to stopping this super league.  

Over to you."

These are not benign people ! This proposed “Super League’ is just one of many outrageous manifestations of their use of this power and of us all being sleepwalked into that situation."

billybobobenner,2021-04-20T11:28:48Z,0,"In a perfect world there wouldn't be a European Super League, but there wouldn't be a Premier League or a CL either. The Old First Division and European Cup setup worked just fine. Both the PL and the CL were designed to make more money for the clubs involved in those competitions and these latest proposals are an extension of that. For the PL, Uefa and Fifa to oppose it on 'moral' grounds that it minimises competition etc is laughable - all they care about is that it will end their power and influence. The hypocrisy of Gary Neville nearly in tears on Sky is laughable. If he was still playing for Utd, would he leave if they joined the Super League - of course not. The PL have themselves to blame. If you allow your teams to be owned by the likes of The Glaziers, FSG, Abromovich and Arab states, then this is what you get. They have invited the devil in to their house and now they're moaning when he's setting their house on fire. Football has been ruined by money and the very people who made that happen are up in arms because other people are going to make the money that they have been making.

The levels of hypocrisy are staggering."

Healthy soil nutritious food healthy people...that's what football is about ,and how much football profits go into soil replenishment or land purchases for fans who fought wars for English land only to be squeezed into cities ....and the royal patron sitting over the football boards keeping the status quo in place....fair play to them and if the profits from the super league get invested into the Land Fit for Heroes that soldiers were promised back in the the 1920s all the better...  maybe some should be reminded where football actually got it's start .....the campaign for bigger pitchs that never happened."

They are a part of the problem, as is the Premier League. This has been coming for years. And Gary Neville has profited from that greed as much as anyone.

clarke-e2351,2021-04-20T10:24:10Z,0,"Can’t understand why everyone is losing their minds, mid-week competition replacing current European football with a better competition and more money for the competing teams. personally i would prefer to see the Super League with jeopardy linking it with current domestic leagues meaning the two will work in tandem but football has been a corrupt money making scandal for how many years now. Least now there being honest about it and not throwing cash around under the table. Telling me the 2022 Qatar world cup was all above board, or the 2018 Russian world cup, have a laugh. All these people just throwing their toys out the pram because the minority that bring in the VAST MAJORITY of revenue have turned around and said we don't need you hanging on to our coat tails anymore. If Fifa turn around and say no player that plays for any of the ESL teams are allowed to compete in the World or Euro's, take a wild stab in the dark what happens next. A new tournament will be made its not rocket science. Then you have two competing products one has the best players in the world and the other is Tesco own brand trying to say look at us were cheaper but just as good when we all know it’s not."

However SUPER these clubs believe they are if their countries FA ban them from domestic competition and UEFA ban them from other European competitions and FIFA ban players from world cup competitions, players will not want to join these clubs and clubs will not be able to attract anyone to even put a squad out  for this Super League. The power here I believe is in the players hands, don't sign new deals and move on to a team that hasn't signed up to this, show us it's the competitive football you love and not the money. I'm so disappointed in my club but i'm not surprised considering who is running it and to top it all off one of them is the vice president of this Super League."

Arsenals chairman hasnt had to step down from his eufa duties for this, his club is further in than ours, but as HE HIMSELF HAS SAID, it's a time for us to all stick together, not push single out other clubs for being worse or more scummy than your own.

F1 has been moving towards equalising the competition and will be introducing budget caps next year along with a technical reset to make for better racing and more a sport about talent and skill than biggest bank account. F1 had an exclusive club of top teams getting preferential treatment and prize money, with teams having a direct say on how regulations work. That is all changing to make it more a fair play sport than it has ever been (considering it started purely as a rich man's play thing). Football is doing the exact reverse.

I hated it when Abramovich came here to buy trophies & steal the best players & I hate the fact an oil state can buy Man City & do likewise. Sure football is better than in the 1970/80's but it was organic, anyone could win. Forest, Villa could win titles & European Cups. It's was a working class sport but not anymore. Now it's a joke, bad enough that whoever has the most money usually wins but to create a closed shop of entitlement with an overload of big games is disgusting.It's two fingers to every English Football Fan and it's typical of the American approach to franchise sport. You'll get quarters now and time outs for commercial breaks. VAR and now this, I've had it, they're ruining more than just the game, they are destroying people's lives!!"

slart1bartfast587,2021-04-20T08:29:44Z,0,"I love how they all pretend that this super league is so ""disgusting"" and bla bla bla.
All bigger European leagues, the UCL and the UEFA as a whole are disgusting and a disgrace. How can you not say a word when there is transfers for 100+ mio. Euros every year and players get paid 20+ million Euros per years, when in 28 years of UCL there was only a single instance of a team not from England, Germany, Italy, Spain or France winning it, when Real Madrid, Barcelona or Liverpool have teams with market values close to a billion Euros? But the super league is the disgrace? The super league is what is disgusting? No, it is just the logical progression.
I am from a small country. My nations football league has been degraded over the last two decades to be nothing more than a ""farm league"" for the bigger nations, whereas 3 to 4 decades ago some of our teams managed to get an occasional game in a semifinal or final of a European contest. I my opinion it can all burn to the ground. It wont be missed."

Fifa and UEFA don’t care about clubs or fans, they just watched them go under during the pandemic and did absolutely nothing. Clubs took the initiative and found a solution for their near bankruptcy situation which by the way is the same system UEFA just announced for the CL starting 2024. ESL is not a close system of football, teams can qualify for it and get peace of that pie. UEFA is angry because they used to take almost 70% of the CL revenues and now this is gone. It’s going straight to clubs. I’m excited for the ESL and can’t wait for it to start."

It took 30 years for Spurs to start catching up,they still haven't ,hence no trophies,and now Leicester,West Ham,Everton are catching up,it was only inevitable these so called 'Big' clubs would feel threatened and want to break away to protect their unfair advantage they've had for years,and jealous foreign teams who don't get huge British tv money would want a piece of the pie.The Premier league and the champions league started all this greed years ago and the European Super League is a continuation of that"
anthonydouglas9129,2021-04-20T05:43:43Z,0,Football is big business for the top 6 and profit comes first. Fans need to think big and start their own clubs and stop relying on foreign billionaires. The problem is the fans lack of ambition to setup and control their clubs.

bonnybonny8337,2021-04-20T05:39:32Z,1,I fully support the Super League and I cant wait to see it. I am excited by the prospect. Even in boxing...the top contenders do not have to fight everybody to retain/ win the title. They only fight the best. The pandemic was a wake up call to all football clubs...because if  the bigger clubs which we love most are not going to remain financial sustainable in future pandemics how will the 'smaller' clubs be?. Let us not run away from the fact that in-order to run top global clubs people need huge amounts of money. Call it greed. I call it investment/business. Maybe the problem is with the structure which can be improved to include everyone..but the Super League is the future of football.

A clan organization in North America attempted to purchase the place about 10 years ago with a strong bid of about $3 million, just about the asking price. Some Russian billionaire swooped in and overpaid to discourage all other bidders with his own bid for $10 mil and not only that...but puts in gates and tall trees so that nobody can ever see the auld castle ever again. They don't care. Britain needs to work on its historic property ownership standards. Sorry...I went a bit off there, but it is a similar problem in football.

It's a very similar situation, greedy billionaires wanting more for them & less for everyone else, but this is far more dangerous because it will affect every aspect of everyone's lives.
If you don't know what I'm talking about then type in The Great Reset Explained In 5 Minutes into Youtube or watch the documentary The New Normal on Bitchute or just head over to the WEF's own website where they've got every aspect of our lives planned out in minute detail.

Lying, stealing, using God’s name in vain, and lusting are some sins we’ve all committed. Because God is holy and just, sin must be punished, so we all deserve hell since we all fall short of His perfect standard. But Jesus, being Man and God, lived a perfect sinless life and died on the cross for our sins. He paid the full debt of our sins then rose from the dead on the third day!! Without Jesus, we have no hope. We can’t do anything to save ourselves, but God made a way for us to be reconciled to Him which is though JESUS!! God is gracious and merciful to give us the gift of eternal life if we believe in Jesus Christ and His death for our sins and resurrection! So turn to Jesus and believe!🤍The book of John is a great place to start reading the bible :)"

In the past 2 or 3 years, my love for the game has waned greatly. The money is just ridiculous and some of the corruption is sickening.

Because we always never see the best play against the best not even in the champions league. And the smaller clubs have no chance to clasify to the champions league and if they do they don't get past the group stage. Even the Europe league is mostly won by the rich clubs. Let's let the rich clubs play against each other in the super league and smaller clubs but still top 10 clubs from domestic leagues play each other in the champions league. So they have more money and a chance to win it. Smaller clubs having more money means National leagues will be more competitive.

pedroarielmenendezdelcueto4595,2021-04-20T00:27:44Z,0,"You are wrong, Neville. You can not take away points from the clubs for doing that.  As far I as know those clubs never said they wanted to leave the premier league.  The premier league is kicking them out because they do not want to play the champions league. I was not aware that was mandatory to play in the champions league.  Before you go ahead punishing the players and fans for doing nothing wrong, UEFA is the bad guy on this matter, they do not want to lose those clubs from the champions, therefore they are forcing the domestic league to punish them where they can't. 
 I do not like the proposed format for the super league, I agree that it removes competitiveness from the tournament, but UEFA just announced something similar today, I think they only did it to please the big clubs, which will tell you how desperate UEFA does not want them leaving.  You all keep telling this is about money but UEFA is all about the money,  FIFA and UEFA have been proved to be corrupted and we let them rule the football even after that.  Now they are showing how meddlers they are by forcing the domestic leagues, to do something as stupid as expelling clubs from a tournament or banning the players from playing internationally.  I think they are terrified of losing those clubs from UEFA tournaments but what they are doing is even worse than stating you do want to be part of UEFA tournaments. 
From my point of view, if UEFA  were not doing these for the money those clubs bring in, this is what should happen 
-20 teams decide they do not want to  play in UEFA tournaments and that they will make their own league apart from UEFA ( IT IS  NOT MANDATORY TO PLAY IN UEFA TOURNAMENT AND YOU CAN'T PUNISH A TEAM FOR CHOOSING NOT TO DO IT)
-UEFA should agree because they are not telling UEFA what to do, and they are not forcing any club to join in with them. They are simply choosing where to play.
-Every domestic league should continue the same, and every player should keep their right to play for the national team.

I agree these clubs are greedy and they are walking in a grey moral area but UEFA is as greedy as they if not more.  
I think the only way to bring in more clubs to the SUPER LEAGUE it would be removing the rule where founding member can't miss out of the next tournament. 
It has been a long time since football is not about money, football is a business whether we like it or not. 
I do not like any of what is going on but above all that you can not punish a team (from a sporting point of view), a player, or the fans for something that is happening outside the field."
andylauchoira,2021-04-20T00:27:27Z,0,The day you sell your clubs to dirty oil money owners you would expect things like that will happen down the road. They don't care about your club history. All they care about is Money.

But the hypocrisy from UEFA and the FA is despicable, the EPL opened the door for this by allowing foreign owners to plough money in to the game and giving the league a corporate feel to it and taking it away from the working person. UEFA make teams who have won their domestic league playe 4 qualifying rounds for the champions league whilst allowing teams who finish 3rd in their league straight in to the play off round and why??? Because they contribute more money to UEFA through there domestic allocation. Hypocrisy at it's worst. This will be the end for the EPL and end the bond between supporters and the clubs.

2. The motivation is greed? Really? It’s been always the motivation by the owners. That’s why little Johnny don’t play for Man United who was born in Manchester, and Paul Pogba is. 

3. The criminal act is when you call your team Manchester United and the players on the current rooster were born Lagny-sur-namne or Salto or Maia or Amerfoort or Madrid or Massy or Belo Horizonte etc. 
This is what logically the next step. I am against it but you people didn’t cry when your team started to have more foreign players then domestic, now you will loose your team.

European football system will become what the Brazilian football system looks like. There they have states championships (equivalent to national leagues in europe) as pre season for the top flyers. These states championships sometimes have even a 5th division but most of the states have only 3 divisions.
I dont understand all the hype tho. When the clubs got together and broke away from the FA controlled league to create the Premier league, some people thought, great. It is the same thing on a European level now. UEFA and the rest of the national federations would have no choice but to recognise the new league's  top tier level."

Every genuine fan will not renew their season tickets, and they will not be able to give away their freebie tickets to put bums on seats. The TV companies should protest, and not cover it.... who will watch it? No one and all that money they get from participating will be spent on players and expenses, there will be no spectacle, if no one is there to spectate. When it flops, and they think that they were better off in the domestic system, the FA's of their respective countries should allow them back, BUT, like when Rangers relaunched themselves a few years ago, the price of the readmittance MUST BE, you start at the bottom of Non-League. Here they will see the reasons we have a Football Pyramid, because they will be subject to it. They should be forced into salary caps, and other financial limitations which I presume are already in place to help the clubs around them survive, no Multi million sponsors, players, etc etc, although unlike Rangers.... there are a damn more non league competitions to get through than up in Scotland in this countries football ladder."

But we need to avoid turning this into another episode of club rivalry! None of the fans of the six british clubs want this breakaway league: largely foreign businesspeople have made this move. The people of Liverpool and Manchester have not betrayed the spirit of their clubs, they have been betrayed by the owners. We need to all stand together and oppose the greed of the owners in order to protect british football. In that respect, the history and the spirit of the fans in clubs like Man U and Liverpool is even more important at a time like this. YNWA"

A bit hypocritical coming from a Sky presenter considering that they themselves were behind a breakaway league called the 'premier league', before the top clubs broke away football was free to view on terrestrial TV.

So Sky and Neville can spare me the crocodile tears about those nasty top clubs starting a breakaway European league to replace the Champions League.

veronho1ness,2021-04-19T21:42:33Z,0,"A European Super League isn't for the fans, even though the clubs will tell you this.
It is all about the TV rights and the money that it produces. The fans are considered last. 

The attraction of the original European Cup, was that fans saw their team playing against foreign opposition on the rare occasion their team qualified. 
The champions of each league played each other in a 2 leg knockout format, meant exciting midweek games, 
with memorable matches that have gone down in many clubs folklore. 


The change to the Champions League, was and is a format which they can milk the TV rights by extending the number of matches being shown. 
Let's be honest the games only get exciting when it reaches the knockout stages.


As we have seen this season, with the empty stands, there is no atmosphere. The fans make the atmosphere which also makes the games exciting. I wonder if the TV rights would be attractive without urging and cheering there teams on?

The fact that you will be seeing these teams play each other, week in week out, will do away with that mystique and it will become merely ordinary."

Personally i would love to see the new league format happen. Top notch games week in- week out. No more meaningless trophy nonsense and no more paying 4 different streaming services a total of over 80€ a month just so i can follow 1 club? Very rich hearing sky (the ultimate viewing license hoggers) talk about greed. Then theres the Topic of UEFA. Do i think the new league is going to be better than them? Probably not, but i’ll still happily watch everything UEFA (and FiFA for that matter) stand for burn to the ground so we can start anew. I hope the league happens, and I hope that once it does they enable a relegation System after a few years. You wanna fix football? No more privately owned clubs, equal fixed spending limits for all. If that doesn’t sound fun, and you just wanna see a small number if heavily finances teams battle it out for European supremacy, this league would actually be a way forward. The smaller clubs actually have a real chance of achieving something meaningful (without a financial injection that makes sustainability budgets look like a joke)."

If only the premier league had a leg to stand on when letting countries with atrocious humans rights records, money launderers and former conmen buying English clubs. I wonder if Gary would be so incensed if he was a decent coach and was currently employed by Man utd.

Neville, Keane and the rest would all argue that they are better qualified etc. etc. So then we have the people who own the clubs trying to conduct their business as they see fit for their investment - and perhaps it will be better for the fans? - but Neville and his like seem to think that they'll just step in and tell them it's not happening!!!

Without that history and support i would have never been living in a villa , having that gorgeous wife and driven that expensive car. Never. Ever. 
So now, in support of those who supported us, we as players and coaches will do everything to sabotage these plans. 
Its up to them, to pay us back. And the few that will take that extra money and do go along with these club owners will be shamed publicly , will loose respect and image they so want to portrait trough their fck social media teams.

pickledaardvark1532,2021-04-19T19:52:26Z,0,"Customers demanding that businesses do what they tell them? Tell the city councils to buy the clubs and the people can own them - if they are willing to spend the money - and that way football will really belong to the fans. Otherwise, accept that owners of businesses can do what they want with the things that they legally bought, and pay for the resulting product or not as you see fit.
""Created by the poor. Stolen by the rich!"" would in fact be, ""Created by the poor. Sold to the rich!"". Welcome to the consequences of capitalism. If you don't like it, start your own clubs, set wage caps, control ticket prices, accept lower standards of players and the game will truly belong to the people. Or alternatively introduce the idea of common ownership regardless of who paid for what and see where that takes the country."

But I agree with Gary when he says that this league is not meritocratic with the actual formula but is still not confirmed if is gonna be limited or maybe the best of each country league will go to play there or they will find other way to do It more meritocratic. At the end  of the day is like NBA, say for example to Michael Jordan that NBA is not meritocratic, Im curious to listen to his answer."

Every player in the then first division from Alan Shearer were condemning this proposal!

When Skysports were promoting the Premier League in its early stages, all the players that were condemning the Premier League, started talking about how they want to play in the same league in which they were condemning!

Mark my word, if this European Super League is officially launched, it'll be no different from that of the Premier League."

kyleschaeppi9391,2021-04-19T19:12:32Z,2,"Hey guys, I know we are all annoyed at the idea of theEuropean Super League but we have to look at the bigger picture. These clubs aren’t doing this just for the money they are doing to because uefa and fifa control the big tournaments with little work and basically get all the reward. These clubs are taking a stand against them not against small clubs and the leagues they play for. If uefa and fifa really cared about football they would help small clubs that are going bankrupt because the money to bail them out is nothing to them. These clubs tried to negotiate but uefa and fifa are some of the greediest companies ever and won’t give the fair share to all clubs around the world. I’m not in support of separating clubs from leagues or closed leagues but I’m in support of taking a stand against these evil companies that control football."
garyhennell5406,2021-04-19T19:12:23Z,0,"And here is why the German style of ownership was always superior. When historic clubs treat our National Game with such contempt that it insults the heritage & birth place of the biggest sport in the world it tells you all you need to know about foreign ownership. The FA sowed the seeds of this 'land grab' by allowing foreign ownership free reign; now they want their percentage (to hell with tradition, support & fans). The sheer avarice on display reeks of self interest & conceit & if the FA & Premier League have any balls whatsoever they will deduct points from every dumbass club that signed this statement of intent. Thank God Bayern & PSG are showing the world how big clubs should act!"

They were continuously greedy, making other leagues in Europe continuously smaller and smaller, by injecting always more money in their leagues and buying the best players in all the smaller competitions where the salaries were way lower, reforming the European cups and by doing so making the difference between the big and small leagues even bigger, while thinking they were untouchable. Well, the business owners and entrepreneurs showed them that they don't need the EPL, the champions league, etc... to make (more) money. BTW this is capitalism and globalism. This is what the majority of people all around the world think is the best economical system.

Invest in making these clubs great or something, considering the funding for this thing. I honestly don't know. Tell me if I'm wrong or how I'm wrong. I don't fully understand why this is so bad."
walabyla,2021-04-19T18:48:12Z,0,"The markets in China, USA etc. might even make it worth it for the club owners even if all of europe boycotts. But it is so important that every single person having a problem with these businesses (clubs) and ESL boykott it. By not watching, not buying merchandise, not producing digital revenue.
The football business is already fucked up. Look at the FIFA. Katar etc. World Cups are worth boycotting. So is the whole thing to be honest. But it's an inconvenience to do so. Especially since many alternatives like the NBA are just as bad, kissing dictator Xi Jinping's boots after Rockets GM Daryl Morey spoke up for Hongkong.
I dont have much hope that if a Super League happens people will boycott it. Even those crying out now.
But goddamn do i hope they will.
In this time and age you can vote and think about how you spent your time and money. And the later one is actually more impactful.

jamesconnolly3988,2021-04-19T18:23:07Z,0,"While i get where gary is coming from, and agree with him in some aspects of what hes saying. Why isnt he saying the same thing about sky?  Long before all this started with the european breakaway league, it began with sky. They formed a breakaway league themselves which became the premier league. It turned a working class game into an upper middle class game. It priced working class fans out of the game, letting in the middle class people who were no where to be seen on the terraces during the earlier decades. This has led to a lack of atmosphere at games, and for businessmen to come in and take away the identity of a club, because there is no opposition to it. It has led to players employing agents, who demand sigining on fees and setting a players wage demands, making it impossible for a club to sign them unless they are bankrolled by a country, royal family or an oil tycoon. Uefa and sky have done this for decades, and now they have the audacity to complain about greed when they themselves had set the trend for it. Im not surprised this has happened, it was inevitable. Sky and uefa started the greed, they cant complain when someone else surpasses it."

It started way back when the Glazer family took over Man United, Abramovich took Chelsea, Fenway Sports Group took Liverpool, Joe Lewis took Spurs, Kroenke took Arsenal and, worst of all, the United Emirates took Manchester City. By letting the involvement of private investors, companies and even governments (most of which foreign) happen without serious regularization or protests, the Premier League, the English fans and English football in general paved the way to what is happening right now.
To me it seems extremely hypocrite that now everyone (league, fans, experts etc.) seems to be disgusted by this development whereas until a couple of days ago the money from the US, Russia, United Emirates etc. was welcomed because it served the purpose of making the Premier League and its clubs stronger and more wealthier in comparison to German clubs for instance."

lox4943,2021-04-19T17:49:17Z,1,"Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .

The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .

Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . 
Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..

Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; 

Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) . 

Do these things, and you will be saved .

If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife . 

You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true .

Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;

‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ ."

Anonym-dx2tp,2021-04-19T17:48:31Z,0,"But you have to say that football has been purely commercial for years. Bayern wins in the Bundesliga every year; in France PSG and Italy mostly Juve. The new league would make it a lot more interesting. Most of the top clubs are stock corporations ergo focus on making money and making profit. So the current fallacy does not come from nowhere, but is simply the conclusion of the whole. Football isn't what it was for a long time. It would be best if there were the draft system in and among the top 5 leagues in Europe and a cost and salary cap. Like in the NBA, that would make football more interesting not a Super League."

Only fan pressure stopped that and it will only be fan pressure that stops this. These AND the other clubs have shown their greedy morals and utter contempt to the loyal fans that built the clubs I really do hope that messers Klopp, solskjaer, Guardiola and others were unaware of this move or it brings into question their judgment. Well done and thank you to Bayern, Dortmund and PSG for having the guts to say no! much respect and for what it’s worth, you now have one more English fan!"

Football is who we are as a nation, we fight we get knocked down we rise back up we battle we hit the top, then free fall back down to think anyone in this country thought this was a good idea, YOU ARE AN EMBARRASSEMENT. If this is allowed to go ahead the heart of this country will die, as I am sure other European countries as well, all my life I have loved football, even when we are getting beat, and yes we cursed them up and down and all became experts. That was the joy, match day regardless of who you support was an epic day out, it lost its way a bit when the hooligans started but it came back, it was a hiccup that is all. Travelling to other parts of England to watch our team was always a laugh and usually a fundraiser at the same time. I honestly want to cry. but am so angry I can't."

I think the answer will be yes, football as been fuelled by greed for years now probably since the introduction of the premier League and the champions League in it's current format where finishing fourth gets you to the gig! Footballers, Managers, commentators and Clubs whether it be this 6 or any of the other football clubs do not give a damn about the fans they have long just been after our MONEY. £500k a week, up to £100 a ticket everyone and there Grandad raking a living from being a pundit.
Anyway back to the point when SKY broadcast it these three will all be there being pundits I guarantee it.
Football is a short lived career they deserve it! Do me a favour when football is over get off the gravy train and get a job."

malkit21,2021-04-19T17:26:54Z,0,"Great words from Neville but this is nothing new. The UCL was created to give more money and places to teams from England, Italy, Spain, Germany etc. They get 4 direct places in the group stages while traditional powerhouses from lesser leagues such as Ajax, PSV, Red Star Belgrade  and Steaua Bucharest have to start qualifying in June and go through 3-4 qualifying rounds just to get into the group stages. Add the fact that most English teams have wealthy Russian, American, Middle Eastern and Chinese owners and have huge TV deals, how were teams from other countries supposed to keep up? PSG can only compete with the EPL as they went down the same round with their Qatari owners. Real and Barca can only compete as they have better TV deals than their competition in Spain and the fact that they have recognised brand name. 

For sure this is motivated by greed but the EPL was based on greed from the outset and UCL has been run on greed since it changed to allow the 2nd, 3rd and 4th best teams to compete from a select few countries. This has resulted in all of the wealth basically being concentrated in the EPL along with PSG, Barca, Real, Bayern and Juventus. Of these teams the only one with some ethics are Bayern. 

As a result we are seeing far less winners of major competitions. 

European Cup Winners 1985 to 1995 - Juventus, Steaua Bucharest, Porto, PSV Eindhoven, AC Milan x3, Red Star Belgrade, Barcelona, Marseilles and Ajax (9 teams from 7 countries)
UCL Winners 2010 to 2020 - Inter Milan, Barcelona x2, Bayern Munich x2, Real Madrid x4, Liverpool and Chelsea (6 teams from 4 countries).

Uefa Cup Winners 1985 to 1995 - Real Madrid x2, Gothenburg, Leverkusen, Napoli, Juventus x2, Inter Milan x2, Ajax and Parma (8 teams from 5 countries)
Europa League Winners 2010 to 2020 - Sevilla x4, Atletico Madrid x3, Porto, Chelsea and Manchester United (5 teams from 3 countries)

Serie A Winners 1981 to 2000 - Juventus x6, AC Milan x6, Inter Milan x2, Napoli x2, Verona, Roma & Sampdoria and Lazio (8 teams in 20 years)
Serie A Winners 2001 to 2020 - Juventus x12, Inter Milan x5, AC Milan x2, Roma (4 teams in 20 years)

You will see this replicated across most competitions - Ligue 1, Bundesliga, La Liga etc."

Can someone please tell me what the issue is with having teams play an extra game in the week that wouldn’t affect their league matches. Shame to see such a ridiculous response from a company who’s butt hurt that they don’t already have the TV rights. If they had an agreement in place already, the message we would be hearing is how great this new league is. 1-0 ESL."

michaelj611,2021-04-19T17:14:57Z,0,"Fk em, let them go. Ban them from the domestic leagues and cups. Let Man C get their title then give them the boot. The 6 playoff teams get promoted, 3 get relegated for the next 2 yrs. Ban them from International football and watch the players jump ship to go to PL teams or the likes of De Bruyne and the big draws can choose to play for Bayern, PSG  etc and still represent their country. If Fifa stand strong on their threats, that league will end up being a retirement home for the superstars whose best days are behind them and want 1 last big contract before hanging up their boots. 
And if these teams want to come back, they'll have to start at the bottom and try and work their way through the leagues. 
Somebody who is used to relative success will end up bottom of this league, their fans will soon get fed up and may even jump onto a more accessible team who they can watch live without needing to travel to the continent. 
The papers and broadcasters should give it the cold shoulder and not report on or show the games. The PL will carry on without them and they'll be replaced in no time.
Some of these teams aren't traditionally as big as the ones staying anyway. ManC weren't all that big not that long ago, they'll be replaced"

Quite happy to earn handsomely during the sky TV era. 

Did Neville think about the common fan when he was pushing for his £50k a week? 

Does he have any opinion on players like Phil Jones who are stealing a living?

What about the players who expect the clubs to pay their agents for the negotiations they undertake? The agent works for the player FFS. How about commenting on that greed.

ElTamauro,2021-04-19T17:05:43Z,0,"How naive, if not stupid, you have to be to argue that football is the sport of the people as an expression of meritocracy and equality. Naville's Man United have won all those titles because they buy the best players from the less rich clubs and the same goes for ALL the top European teams, where is the meritocracy in that? Fans who attribute values ​​such as equality or democracy to football are poor fanatics and are the bane of football. Football is a game, nothing more, it's just entertainment, values ​​such as equality and domocracy are much more important issues that fortunately are not managed by spoiled millionaires that the only thing they have done in life is to kick a ball. Football clubs are brands and as such those who manage them have every right to decide how to make the most of them and this happens in any entertainment sector and those who benefit most from it are the fans who enjoy a better show. and this is and must be the only value to attribute to football."

The joy of football is not just the heritage of the football club, but also the feeling of happiness of when thrashing a weaker team and similarly the sadness of upset by weaker teams. The happiness of winning a league you have not won for ages, the thrill of promotion and agony of relegation. I'm not sure if we will get the same excitement seeing a classico every week or LFC vs Man UTD every other weekend with the same set of football players no matter how skillful they are. - From a Southeast Asia LFC fan"

That'll be the future of this now plastic fake ""sport"". Its all fake. Its all purchased in an auction room prior to the season starting. Theres no way a team such as steaua Bucharest will ever win that trophy again...they simply wouldn't allow the flow of energy to go anywhere 'they' the owners of the fake plastic game , don't want it to travel..to. just start again. The game was invented for everyday folks to enjoy.  I knew this was gonna happen. Thats why I wrote a script for a computer game, which they, yes them again will never allow to be published.

By doing that we have increased transfer fees and salaries. So if everyone wants to make it fair then have a salary cap on the league. This will never happen but would make it fair for all 20 teams.

Leicester City are showing people how a club should be ran. These so-called ""top 6"" who ironically not all of them are in the top 6 this season, need to take their thumb out of their asses and ears and listen to the supporters.
Football in this country was built for the working man. The working man of this country. It's played in schools in and around the country and the world. How would they (owners) feel if someone told them that the sport they hold dearest to themselves will be ripped away from them and replaced with an unopposed set of 6 teams, 10 teams, whatever and they'll just play the same old teams each season with no relegation, no promotion and in fact nothing to play for? I hope the FA/UEFA take heed and deduct points from them immediately and fine them. Yes, update the game by all means, but not like this. Well said Gary. You've gone up in my estimation now."

sdasdsadsa5444,2021-04-19T16:53:35Z,0,my question is why cant they create their own league and play in premier league and champions league all this is a league between the best. listen the truth is the clubs have no money for the standard to be the best they have no money to sustain the club at its best level maybe ok level but not the best.

danielde7542,2021-04-19T16:52:51Z,0,"I agree that greed is the sole reason they are doing this. But no-one is convincing me that the UEFA and FIFA are selfless in this. Ever since the Blatters and Platinis of the world have been involved in this cabal, it has only gotten worse. Gone are the days that only champions would participate in the 'Cup for Club Champions'  or the Cup Winner's Cup. It is only money, and more money. And I understand the reaction of everyone against this ESL and I understand UEFA's stance. But I do not believe the UEFA too have the best interests at heart. The sport has to be ridden from player merchants, corrupt oligarchs and greedy sheikhs.

Sorry if my English isn't good enough, I am not a native speaker."

If you want to preserve the soul of the sport, than start thinking bigger. Is this about greed? Yes, but it's so much more than that....stop being so myopic. It's greed but its also GLOBAL ECONOMICS, CONTROL AND POWER. This announcement is a strategic decision that started years and years ago (when so many clubs gladly accepted the money of the billionaires). The common voicetrack of these commentaries is ""they don't understaned OUR country"", ""history of OUR game"", ""history and tradition of OUR sport""....ME, ME, ME, US, US, US, OURS, OURS, OURS......time to get OUR head out of OUR asses and start thinking more globally and strategically, if we want to save OUR game."

The FA will have to wait until this season is finished but don't continue their admission to the Football League from the end of this season.  Expel them from everything domestic, I'm sure UEFA will ban them from European competition.  The players don't need those clubs, they will find work elsewhere, but the clubs need the fans and players more than the other way around.  Let's see how much money they make in their single competition with the 9-12 teams in it.  It almost feels like an April Fools but a few weeks too late."

I think they could just adjust the Champions League so the group stages drop down to the round of 16 instead of 32.  That'll increase the chances of glamour teams playing each other.  Or, take it a step further, and get down to the round of 8, and then make it one big group stage where all 8 teams play each other home and away, and then the top four point scorers go to the semis.
I'd hate for teams like Burnley and Southampton to lose out on playing teams like City because they have to keep playing Olympiacos."

Chris_Andre_Boxing,2021-04-19T16:19:34Z,0,"The beauty of football is unpredictability and the fact that anyone can dream. That's what makes it special. The fact that we know giants are favourites but still have seen things like Greece win the euros, Leicester win the prem, Porto win the UCL, etc. As a fan of the giants, your interest lies in wanting to dominate and establish yourself as a the top dog, consistently. So everyone has their own football dreams and everyone hunts in the same enclosure. It's a beautiful thing. Can a lowly wolf overcome a weakened lion? So we all watch. Whereas the moment you tell the wolf ""you cant even have a shot at the lion, and the lions will only fight among themselves"", it kills the excitement. It kills fans' abilities to dream. 

Also in the short term it might be exciting to see lions constantly fighting eachother, but in an enclosed isolated system the dominant would get richer and a gap would open up within that super league too. If bayern, real & psg began to pull away from the pack in a league system, it'll also destroy football for fans of the english elite too. Imagine liverpool, arsenal, utd, becoming the equivalent of Burnley, Brighton and Fulham. And because theres no additional comp to qualify for, like the ucl, once a bunch establish themselves as superior, catching them will be impossible, just like its impossible for the likes of burnley to catch city now in the prem. This is the death of football and the rise of sole corporate interests within the game. You might as well watch Tesco vs ASDA, they're businesses that don't represent the fans"

garrypark1119,2021-04-19T16:10:59Z,0,"""The Big Six"" is a self imposed title those clubs gave to themselves and in the past couple of years they have been cultivating this idea through TV, media and other outlets that they are somehow the biggest clubs in England sneaking this idea into our heads for a long time (for example notice how Cadbury's changed their annual competitions from including all Prem clubs to just these six?). 

The owners of these clubs have clearly been scheming behind closed doors for years and now they're making their move like comic book villains looking to line their own pockets by stealing the Moon.

The next few weeks will be critical and it will come down to how UEFA, The FA and The Prem respond and react. If they all just stand around wringing their hands with nothing more than words we know their pockets are going to get lined in the future.

The other sad reality is these types of owners infest many other clubs. Look to your own club, look at the owner and ask yourself if given the opportunity would they also have joined this cash grab? I know mine would. There's the poison, in front of our eyes all along and now the heist has begun."

They could even well let people into the stadiums for free, just to make them look full on television, just as long as the matches have huge TV sales. Refusing to attend matches or buy a TV match broadcast here will make scant difference, as long as there are loads of subscriptions in the rest of the world. Reality TV football - with some of it even potentially scripted. It could become lacklustre after a decade, but by then the money men will have made a killing: loads of profit in the short term. A Hundred years at least for your typical English football club, and all these entrepreneurs  can see is three, maybe five years down the line."

Hey, at the start of lockdown, Sky were charging £14.95 PPV fee to watch Burnley v Newcastle, so Neville and his money rich, hypocritical Sky / Murdoch cronies can STFU.

In the end it will only be a game of not getting relegated.

And possinly even eliminate them. We seen it happen a lot before and we all loved it. Big respects to Gary Neville, personally I love Manchester United. At least until today, he has a point. That club has been created by workers and now they are just leaving to this ""Super League"" of ""Elite"" clubs. What a disgrace to football... So upsetting to see.

People are just sacred of change and are afraid to admit how truly broken football. And the truth is the gap that exists between the between big and small clubs started when the premier league teams did there own break away and when the champions league allowed four teams from multiple leagues to enter.
People talk about the soul of English football well it was sold years ago when they accepted foreign ownership... Now you have foreign owners, managers and players. Only German football has not sold out.

fusionsuper34,2021-04-19T15:47:19Z,0,"Gary Neville is never wrong and is right about why this ESL should be killed off before it becomes reality. Aside from that though - the Premier League should be reformed into the Bundesliga brand and start treating its fans with more respect. Stop with the stupid extortionate ticket prices, the extortionate TV rights that are given to Sky Sports especially - (whom I have to be honest, I hate and are an absolute joke by conning and cheating the fans out of money they charge for watching the games) and start putting money instead into the small clubs, grassroots football and developing young players for the fufure. The clubs should be owned by supporters and not foreign owners.

For the last decade Gary has known about the Fact that the Glazer Family have removed 2 Billion pounds from Manchester United while investing £0. He's also seen them saddle United with hundreds of Millions of pounds of debt and yet he didn't really say much. Then his mate Ole (another fraud) comes in, gets a massive pay rise, and starts telling the fans how well the club is run and backs the Glazers and Woodward at every turn and yet Gary supports him. 

All of sudden though, he's disgusted. Wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that this Super league could create ramifications that would destroy his Club (Salford City) that currently resides in League 2 🤔"

Miracle in Istanbul, losing to Real in the final, corner taken quickly and UCL title in 2019, all those moments of joy and pain being thrown away. All those moments that brought the fans together, being washed like it never happened. A game between Liverpool and Barca or Real is a big occasion. They are games where magical moments happen, unsung heroes rise and now those games are being treated like a game between Watford and Southampton.

I will explain to those who don't understand and even blaspheme ESL. These big European clubs have huge operating costs and have to pay very high-priced players. Meanwhile, their income sometimes does not cover them and they have to be in debt of up to several hundred million euros. In fact, football is making a lot of money. Where did the money go? Yes to the organizer, namely UEFA. And if this big club wins, they will only get a few tens of millions of euros. Still less for operations. Moreover, they also need something called profit. Now, where did the remaining billions go? UEFA scooped it all. And every year we often hear that there are UEFA officials who have corrupted up to several hundred million euros. This is what makes many clubs sick. Meanwhile, those who are told to work hard, compete and stay in the highest caste, and UEFA enjoy the results."

That's something these American owners of Arsenal, Liverpool & Man Utd don't understand. In their model it's a CLOSED group. You can't get in unless there is an expansion team - Like the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars or more recently the NHL's Las Vegas Knights & Seattle Kraken OR there's a relocation of an existing franchise (like Cleveland Browns to Baltimore or Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas) in which case he long loyal and suffering fans of said franchises can only watch as their sports team buggers off to pastures new of the WHIM of an owner. The feeder teams are NEVER and CAN NEVER be promoted UNLESS they are bought and become a franchise of the big league. 

These owners totally misunderstand what the game means in Britain, France, Germany and elsewhere. The idea that a Man Utd can be reasonably successful but then go on a run under Sir Govan and win loads only to go back and someone else steps forward. if you look at how their expansion franchises operate say in Ice Hockey - the NHL allowed Las Vegas a licence, so a Billionaire owner says ""i want my team to be successfull right away"". So they allow him to select 1 player from each of the 30 NHL teams and he must take on their salary. What's more in a team of 20 players (12 forwards, 6 Defencemen and 2 goalies) the team can only protect 7 forwards, 3 defencemen and 1 goalie and even then ONLY IF they are under contract for another 2 years. So right away they can take say your 8th best forward, your 4th best Defenceman. That's basically like Liverpool losing Andy Robertson or losing Firminio with NO COMPENSATION!!!. No wonder they have zero respect for our game"

All the networks fearing the worst because they'll all lose their mega money salaries! These people want to run this midweek so the premier league would still continue. Where do you think these clubs will be getting their new players from? The money will still filter down. The NFL have just signed a $110 Billion contract, so imagine the amount for a sport with a global audience. Alan Hansen summed this up decades ago, football isn't a sport it's a business! Those incharge weren't bothered selling our clubs to these people and now they've come back to bite the hands that fed them, serves them right. These present owners didn't ruin football, those that allowed these owners to pass the fair tests are the ones culpable.

Sure. I believe you. Soccer died when Chinese billionaires and Arab princes start to buy teams all across Europe. There is already zero competition. How many teams can buy CR7 or Messi or Neymar. 3? 4? Guess what, in the ESL , all 15 will be able to. At least it will be competitive in between them every year. What?

It shouldn't be mid week throughout the season, and it definitely shouldn't have THAT price tag behind it.  Just get rid of the champions league, or just take the top 2 teams from the top 5 leagues at the end of the season, then have a round robin to see who's the best club in Europe.  Cause lets face it, the group stages of Champions league is a farce.  Everyone knows who's going through every time and it only gets interesting around the QF's.  The smaller clubs haven't won in like the last 30 years, besides Porto, and Red Star Belgrade back in the 90/91 season.

It shouldn't be a league, just a tournament after the domestic season is already over, in the summer where we can really see who's the best team in Europe."

Personally I´m interested to have great games where great teams are playing versus each other in a weekly basis instead of crapola games from teams who are not even known.
I believe great teams have the right to create this super-league, it´s gonna bring tons of money, tons of people worldwide who wanna watch these great teams play each other.
UEFA has nothing to say or try to control these great clubs, teams and players. UEFA is like a Mafia that wants to control these clubs for their own interest.
This was done already like 20 years a go with Basketball, what´s the deal now? Football clubs can´t do the same? Why not?
We will be able to see the best clubs, best teams, best players weekly."

pb7491,2021-04-19T14:07:43Z,0,"Have been on Man Utd's LinkedIn page to voice my disgust at this idea.... I'm done if it goes ahead, done.  Glazers are horrid owners, but not sure where I can go from here regardless of their decision moving forwards.  My Son, 14, said to me this morning ""so that's the end of football then, Dad?"" he was really upset about it. And I've got no reason to say it isn't.

And do not buy the whole ""we will still compete in the EPL""... yes, maybe for a few seasons until they get settled and pull then eventually plug on their EPL ties.

The  real joke here is that these teams were complaining only recently about playing too many games and wanting a reduced league... now they want to play even more games.  


Just appalled by this decision and yet another nail in the coffin for me where Football is concerned."

If this Super League gets up and running then forget Tottenham I will be done with them. If they have agreed now to go in to it next Season, then stop Tottenham and City in the League Cup Final this Sunday. Give the League Cup to Brentford as they got to the Semi Finals, the other team in the Semis United are a part of the six so forget them also. Uefa should also kick Arsenal and United out of Europa League and Chelsea and City from the Champions League. The Premier League should also kick Chelsea out of the F.A Cup and award it to Leicester, in the League Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea, United, Liverpool and City should be relegated as from now. Then let the others play out the remaining fixtures against each other to see who wins the League. It is no surprise that there are 6 Clubs from England being asked to be Founding Clubs, compared to only 3 in other Countries. The Spanish Clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona are in debt, so are Juventus in Italy. It is no surprise that the Premier League is the most viewed League in the World. Not to mention the Premier League Clubs get much more money in TV Revenue that what they do in other Countries. Clubs in the Premier League don't have to worry about income compared to other Clubs around the World (excluding PSG). The issue now is the other big Clubs around Europe can see that the Premier League is getting stronger. Clubs can compete now with wages, transfer fees and are getting stronger in Europe. In the next 10 Years the Premier League Clubs will dominate European Football and the Premier League will get bigger and will get more money in TV Revenue. It it a more Competitive League compared to all the others, the F.A Cup is the most glamorous Domestic Cup Competition in the World. So there is no reason for English Clubs to want to join the Super League, the only reason is greed and wanting more money. Also it doesn't help that most of the Clubs are owned by owners from Abroad, who don't care about the tradition of English Football and it's History. I can see why others want English Clubs to Join because like I said they are in Debt, so they need the Money to get out of it, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus. These Clubs all should be punished and made examples of, Italy did it to them teams who were Fixing Matches. They all got relegated including the biggest Club Juventus, so that's what should be down when Clubs show total disrespect to their Fans and the League they represent"
dia6olo34,2021-04-19T13:53:37Z,0,"Gary Neville is an idiot who sounds very bitter and jealous! These football clubs don’t owe you anything, they don’t owe you a living.
As for FIFA and UEFA as well as the domestic FA’s and their equivalents, they are behaving like these clubs belong to them! Well they don’t, contrary to what many think they are businesses and are free to interpret what’s best for them, their business without the aforementioned meddlers who have been lining their pockets at the expense of clubs for long enough.
If these children don’t want to play and are threatening to take their ball home (FIFA, UEFA as well as the domestic FA’s and their equivalents) then I say good riddance to them because there will only be one winner here and it isn’t them. These big clubs are the ones who pull the big sponsorship money in they pretty much monopolise the fan base across the globe and without them FIFA, UEFA and the likes are nothing!!!"

In the end there is a huge chaos, no more money is poured in and the basic supply falls into other hands.  A little maturity wouldn't have been bad to be able to see that vacation fantasies are not as heavenly as they first look ^^ And such people want to see themselves as grown men ... Above all Agnelli, who is thrown out against Ajax, Lyon and Porto one after the other  and sees itself as a world power xD These are more like its conquerors from the Neapolitan suburb of Benevento (who, by the way, have built up prosperity with wind power)"

FIFA selling board seats to Arabs and accepting Qatar as a World Cup venue don’t tell me the whole industry is run by crooks.  Fair Competition rules means you wont be able to stop the clubs making their own league and existing TV rights holder contracts will all be under scrutiny if the FA kick out the top 6.

jjerg,2021-04-19T13:00:15Z,0,"It's inspiring to hear Gary Neville defend football. This sport, created in England, has spread to every corner of the world. It has a special place in the soul of almost every culture and it spread before radio. Manchester built the honor of United and City, London grew the tradition of Arsenal and Chelsea and the entire league system and the nation it grew from built the prestige these clubs earned. Now these owners, whose only connection to the team is their $£€, want to take it away."

The ESL will mean BIG Global TV/Data & only Superstars playing Superstars! It will mean the accelerated concentration of wealth & power imposed upon a largely servile {because constantly entertained & therefore docile} Global football audience. Its a disaster for the EPL in terms of the EPL being the World's premier league & in terms of the smaller EPL clubs that are subsidized by that No 1 status but its a Pandemic monster that won't be stopped for obvious economic reasons {no live gates or stadium proceeds} & because of what it will bring to an increasingly remote, digitally tuned in & globally uniform humanity..."

sebastianoliver163,2021-04-19T12:50:17Z,0,"It makes me ashamed to be a Chelsea fan. I love Chelsea, but if we go into this ESL then it's like we are having our soul ripped out, I'm feeling genuinely sick because of these proposals.  Chelsea would never be in the Champions League again, it makes me so sad. Also the whole point of football is that we can do badly, like obviously I don't want us to but we could get relegated if we do badly, now that is actually a good thing cause it makes you see how lucky you are and it makes you appreciate every win when we are doing well.



 Also my Mum is from Northern Ireland and so I also follow a team in the NI Premiership, Carrick Rangers. Now the thing about the current system is there is always the possibility, however small, that maybe we could somehow get into the UCL, cause if you win the Premiership you get into the UCL qualifiers etc, but if this ESL is created there is no way of that happening. It's not just smaller English, Spanish and Italian teams that are being destroyed, it's every team in every other European country.



 Thirdly, the whole point of football is that small team can do incredible teams, I could come up with thousands of examples, e.g. currently the Italian side Atalanta who have always lived in the shadows of Inter and AC Milan are finally doing really well and consistently getting into the UCL through merit, but if the ESL proposals get completed then they will get thrown back down into the depths of nothingness never to play against the two big sides near them ever again, how is that fair considering they are, some might argue, better than Milan at the moment.



 In conclusion, this idea is a perversion of the game. It's like these Chinese, American and Russian millionaires have rapped our beautiful game. I genuinely feel sick."

I am not that hopeful though about no one watching it. Probably a smashing success in a couple of years. Sincerly, sincerly hope I am wrong."

domenicodevivo5318,2021-04-19T12:45:26Z,0,Cut these clubs out of the league completely. Erase them from history and ban the players playing elsewhere so they can get used to just playing against the other 11 clubs in the 'super league'. Arsenal and Spurs should also get used to be being near the bottom too as they will never have another easy game.

We never win trophies, but watching us grow from a floundering team to one of the more threatening forces in football has filled me with immense pride. I never expected we'd be part of a ""Big 6"", I followed them for the culture, the unity, I loved the players and our shitty team, no matter how hard we struggled to take a single point off a Top 4 team.

Our journey has been amazing, so has Leicester's, and it's been cathartic to be part of the ride. Every team deserves the opportunity to feel this, and us deciding to separate  from the pack, it's like turning our back on the process that let us become what we are. So disheartening."

They'll have an unfair advantage due to additional revenue that is not available to excluded clubs, and this is revenue that they have not earned on the pitch. I guess the argument is that this extra revenue will trickle down to smaller clubs when their players are bought by ESL clubs, but that would just create a greater imbalance in the league, making it more difficult for smaller teams to break into the 'top 6'. It's the same reason I'm not a fan of oligarch money in football. 

I'm an Arsenal fan, so I'll speak from my perspective. Why the hell would we qualify as one of these ""elite"" ESL teams? We're a mid-table club now! I'd feel dirty if we kept getting spanked in the ESL but consistently finished high in the PL, because of the ESL money."

eamomuppet,2021-04-19T12:20:05Z,0,"Ban City and Chelsea from this season’s C.L. pick out four teams that have been knocked out and let them play for a semifinal place ,"
FuckFeminists,2021-04-19T12:20:03Z,0,"To resist this, consider doing your bit.
1. Know that this isnt done yet. The easiest way to do something against the will of the people is to make it seem like its already done. It is not.
2. The FA, PL, UEFA, Serie A and La Liga, and others, and clubs like Bayern Munchen, PSG and others - plus all of us native supporters - oppose this. Resistance is in your hands.

3. Whenever something might be dodgy, ask: Why Now? Like here - is it because the clubs have been remodelling their business to grow revenue streams due to lack of gate sales due to the Lockdown? Is it because FFFs (fake foreign fanboys) in other parts of the world are now paying enough broadcast fees to replace the financial need for local support? 
(And even more specific, what about Spurs, Mourinho and Levy actually? Also, was this the real reason why Frank Lampard was sacked - he refused to be a part of this? Might that even be why Tuchel left PSG (who refused to be a part of this), to replace Lampard at Chelsea?)

4. What can you do, to help in identifying whos behind this? Is it the EC ('Oyropean Commission)? It definitely fits their profile, destroying local culture and replacing it with a 'european' alternative, i.e. 'We are just one federalist country, this is your new national league'. Who Are the members of this cartel? The specific names. Who stands most to gain? 
(One group that springs to mind is Tottenham Hotspur's leadership/owner. Spurs are a team that I've never had anything against, but Mourinho is a career criminal and he and Levy stand more to gain than anyone else in the 'big 6' by splitting away into a 'super league' elite. If this was a bigtime criminal matter, as Neville asserts, then the first communications I'd put a tap on would be those between Levy and Mourinho. Woodward too.)
But as important: Are they also figures at the TV channels, the broadcasters? To attempt a breakaway league, they have to know they've got at least one broadcaster in their pocket - who is it? Which broadcaster are they planning on conspiring with?

5. Once you know who these specific figures are: put them under the microscope. What can you stick to them to undermine their position? Also, ask them awkward questions, on record. Get them to expose their position, and reveal the weaknesses in their position. And if the TV networks don't do this, it's a good bet that they're in on it.
Also, become aware of gagging orders, or laws and rules that prevent football people, like managers, from speaking out. Mourinho is a white collar criminal, but why haven't Klopp, Solskjaer, Guardiola, and Arteta, or their staff, said anything? Did they, and the broadcasters don't air it? Whatever it is, they need to be identified and backed into a corner.
 
6. Be aware of the dynamics when you draw the lines. Are FFFs going to be on the side of English culture? Unlikely. Are TV networks a vital part of this cartel? Or do a few of them stand to lose?
One thing where it's not just English people - most Italians, Germans, Spaniards and French (and others) also have the same concerns.

7. Make your voice heard. Football support bases are actually some of the most potentially effective groups when it comes to mobilisation - we already have our networks. These networks need to find a way to join with the other clubs networks of supporters. And importantly, platforms to get heard through representatives, club management, TV figures, and footballers and managers who are listened to.

We're way bigger than the cartel. But we need to act, and find the way forward.
I'm a football supporter, but I'm also a supporter of native culture. And that's why this is a good issue to stand our ground on. Football is about representation, and loyalty. After that, it's about winning. Lets show them our values in action."

monkeybone39,2021-04-19T12:19:01Z,0,Fact is this started way back when the Prem Lg started and when the Champs Lg was changed up to allow non- champions in. Its a bit rich to call this greed when the system we have is built on nothing but greed and profit margins - clubs are on the stock market. I didnt hear Gary Neville shouting about club dominance  when United were flying. Im undecided but we ALL know the FA is not fit for purpose and UEFA and FIFA have continually been linked with corruption; some proven. As for slating the owners? They easily forget that it took these owners to bail these clubs out; both LFC and United were nearly in administration. Methinks there's a few jobs on the line and some are looking after their own greed.  Dont ve fooled by broadcasters such as Sky or even the prem lg; who have NEVER had supporters needs at the fore - remember the failed pay per view or the change of schedules (at a whim)  for TV purposes; leaving fans (year on year) out of pocket. The old 'change 'cycle' is at play; Suggest change - anger ensues. Explain change - gain (some) understanding. Highlight wider benefits to all - wider  acceptance.

I'm NOT a fan of the Super League at all, but to start talking about greed NOW is a joke. What about the last 10 years? The problem is ALREADY there. The Super League is just a drop of water in an ocean of greed. Ticket prices in the PL are extreme... billionaires that have nothing to do with football buy the clubs as financial investments... Qatar is buying the World Cup from a corrupt Fifa organization... and NOW you are surprised that money is ruining football... what a joke. You're either blind or dense if you didn't see actions like this coming. Liverpool has not been ""the peoples club"" for the last 10 years and the same can be said about every other commercially big club in the Premier League. Gary Neville's critique is absolutely spot on... but it's simply far too late. This critique of the clubs being ""criminal towards the fans"" should have been made years ago. If they manage to stop this Super League, then the same critique should definitely also be applied to the Premier League."

Perhaps the worst part is that the people behind this know there'll be a backlash, and they know they'll lose fans - but they've run the numbers and decided that they think they'll make more money in the long run anyway.

MrNepal8848,2021-04-19T11:52:08Z,2,"I think Super League itself is not a bad idea. But in its current form, it unacceptable.
I think super league could be a tournament held at the end of the season for two months. Here is how i think it should work

-Normal League and Champions League finishes on April end
-Super League played from May to June
-20 team divided into 4 group
-All club plays two games, in one week. i.e  8 games in one month
-The group stage will be finished in May
-On June, they start the Quarterfinals, Semis, and Final
-July/August player gets the rest
-August/September normal football begins
Player fatigue is a big issue in this format, but the clubs will rotate squads more and more player will get more playing time as well. Lets face it the 23 mans squad isnt used to full potential in football specially by big clubs.

Truth is clubs are in financial crisis and they need more income source, and no fans in the stadium is killing football as a event and also financially weakning the club. I hope if super league is gonna happen it can be at the end of season."

Just stay objective and wait for their discussion with the governing body, without officiating they can’t play a football game let alone their “world class game” idea. Those 12 clubs did not say if FIFA UEFA and their FA block this idea, we will break away from their current league.

That's what puts the icing on the cake for small teams like these, but they won't get the chance to do this any more.

I was willing to stand by my club, to support it with all my heart and chant along with the rest of my fellow supporters. But I refuse to sit by and watch my club help in the murder of football.

PSG i think only didnt join so far because their owners also own beeing sports which has bought broadcasting rights for champions leauge recently. Bayern Munich i think they are are only carefull and just wait and see how the consequences are are from uefa and the national leagues.  If there is no punishment or massive  negative consequences they won't hesitate to join the superleauge later as well as PSG if beeing sports gets the broadcasting rights.

tesoman12,2021-04-19T11:00:56Z,0,Okay let's calm down. I'm pretty sure if you take a step away its pretty clear this is just a tactic by these clubs to get a bigger piece of the football pie. Let's not forget that these leagues alongside their tv distributers like SKY are just as culpable. Have people forgot how ridiculous it is for someone in England to be paying to watch their Premiership team play per game while in Africa its part of an affordable satellite monthly subscription?  As it currently stands it's easier and cheaper for someone in Kenya to watch a Liverpool game than people in Liverpool. Greed extends to everyone but SKY controls the narrative and will work their level best to ensure the focus is solely on these clubs and not the robbery they've normalized in British society. These clubs have no intention of breaking away but realize they need to pull a stunt like this to force people like the PL and SKY to renegotiate the monopolies they hold over namely the distribution and monetization of football

They dont need us in the arenas and when they get more viewers in asia and america, they dont even need the ""locals"" in front of the television.

The only way to stop this is banning everyone involved from any other competition including national teams, strip of titles, a ban from public service media, taking away their charity statuses etc. etc.. oh, and probably burn down their arenas!

We also have to cancel players who take part in this! Social media, merch etc. etc.. If good players refuse to play there, it might collapse!

theviewer5262,2021-04-19T10:53:07Z,0,"Every word Gary said is exactly right. It’s a disgrace that they’ve even spoken about the idea; as a fan of Sheffield United, a club who were in League 1 for 6 years, got promoted twice with a fan as the manager and a fan as captain, not a great deal of money spent and then finishing 9th in the Premier League last season, that’s the beauty of football. It was amazing, relegation, promotion... it’s what makes football special; football is about highs and lows, following your club through thick and thin and enjoying the ride no matter what. We’re bottom of the Premier League, relegated, we’ve lost our manager - you smile through it and follow your club anyway and you take the bad times with the good. Where is the joy in football if it’s a league of money hungry clubs who can’t be promoted, relegated or even have any genuine competition? Lower league football is what makes English football special; the pyramid is what I and many others love about football."

Torky1965,2021-04-19T10:51:42Z,0,"It's always been the same you only need to look at the Champions League what a misnomer that is, when clubs that aren't even Champions of their own domestic leagues are in it. How can a club that finishes 2nd, 3rd or 4th be anywhere near that league. It's totally unfair how can smaller countries close the gap and cause upsets when the top teams in the top leagues are getting a bigger share of the pot. It makes a mockery of the word 'competition' that word means that everyone has a chance of winning from the outset, but with the bulk of the money going to the elite clubs how can you call it a competition when all sides don't have the same chance of winning and now these clubs want even more money. The game itself can't sustain the amount of money that's in it, if a provincial club like Burnley, Palace or West Ham want to challenge the big 6 clubs they're putting their very existence in doubt. In my opinion the more money that comes into the game the more the lesser clubs will go to the wall and possibly some of the bigger clubs too in chasing an elusive dream. The boys in the studio are totally correct in everything they said the clubs are becoming like Gordon Gecko in the movie Wall Street saying greed is good greed is right but that's total bullshit, money is killing the game at grass roots level. The financial fair play rule was a joke it wasn't fit for purpose frome the outset and both Fifa and Uefa are allegedly so corrupt it's unbelievable, if the game's governing bodies are corrupt then the clubs are thinking why can't we be the same. Both of the games governing bodies need to be cleansed of any corrupt officials and jail anyone who's malfeasant or colluded in any malfeasance that would sort these organisations out to the benefit of the game. This story has legs and it's not the last we'll hear of it hopefully the FA takes these clubs to task over this and as Gary says deduct points hammer them financially and if need be relegate them."

LeeDavies2014,2021-04-19T10:51:38Z,0,"What a load of rubbish. FIFA, UEFA, FA are nothing but money grabbing entities who can't get out of their own way. They have adopted the American system and the teams responsible for most of the revenues don't get what they deserve. No footballer earning over a 100K/wk has any right to comment this is about money. 

They can't even organize properly. As an example, Liverpool had to put out a 2nd stream team against Aston Villa last year to play in the World Club Cup.....all because FIFA wanted to make more money."
colinthompson3111,2021-04-19T10:51:12Z,0,Disagree with Mr. Neville. And minority opinion in the comments. The six English clubs have a responsibility to put on an entertaining game for their fans. Playing the different clubs in the new league every Wednesday will be more entertaining than watching Liverpool play a club that is in the lower half of the table.

Shakhtar Donetsk doing double over Real Madrid. and only that defeat made Madrid rise from ashes again. Common, you LOSE all these beautiful feeling and passion with this super league. I am Real Madrid fan but man I am angry, disgusted and so disappointed. I would probably support Dortmund if it goes through. They are actually destroying this beautiful game.

There is no way on hell that clubs like spurs and arsenal or even ac Milan on current forms should be allowed to automically qualify every year. Only way to counter this is to ban these clubs from playing in their domestic leagues and their players from playing euro and world cup. I don't mind watching Leicester vs benefica in championship league final if all the top players are playing there.

essoteric,2021-04-19T10:44:17Z,1,"This whole Super League b.s. was initiated by the American owners, who only understand the closed franchise system of their sporting leagues. No relegation, no promotion, guaranteed money for the owners year-in year-out. Every other club has just joined the bandwagon driven by only one thing - greed. Its purely a business decision with no thought for the millions of fans right down to the grassroots levels who support their local clubs and dream of playing in the bigger stage, be it through promotion or participation in the sanctioned domestic cups of each countries league. An absolute disgrace and a slap in the face of footballs rich tradition and history."
hibb2887,2021-04-19T10:43:58Z,0,"They never think about the working class people who have spent 20-40% of their weekly wage to go and support these teams week in week out, home and away for decades! If they think there is pressure running a club try being a die hard fan and justifying to the other half that you are prepare to throw away a large percentage of your earnings at a club where players and directors are making millions a year.

These same people also pay for sky tv subscriptions which line club pockets with obscene tv deals, The same people who even in a global pandemic with dire consequences financially for many, have put their hands into their pockets time and time again to purchase season tickets, knowing they were never getting into the grounds to watch their beloved teams. Who purchase merchandise to wear proudly, but only in their own home because they couldn't go out! It's an absolute shambles, the hierarchy should be ashamed of themselves."

It's was called Champions League for a reason. Champions should participate. 4th place is England or Spain, as far as I know, are not champions. But that was ok. That's the problem with our society. When the big clubs don't care about some club in the east, it's fine. Why? Cause its not us (Arsenal, Man UTD, Barcelona, RM etc.). You, the supporters, allowed this and now it's your turn. Most bad things in the world, don't start with a genocide, they start with a slap. If you ignore the slap, it will escalade into something worse. You ignored the slap.

If you type in 'Barclays YOU are football' and then type in 'Barclays long distance relationship' you will see the contrast in marketing. But the truth is big football clubs are big business. And see fans as consumers with extreme brand loyalty. Big Football club 'consumers' are the gift that keeps on giving. They made SKY a mint they created the PL.

However, there have always been two United players that I appreciated, one being Eric Cantona, and the other being Gary Neville.


It's his sense of humour, the fact he build himself an eco-friendly home, the fact that he created University Academy 92... it's hard to dislike such a well-rounded intelligent guy.



And he's nailed it once again, in regards to the silly ""Super League"" idea.



“It’s pure greed, they’re impostors. The owners of Man United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Man City have nothing to do with football in this country. Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham aren’t even in the Champions League. Have they even got the right to be in there? They’re an absolute joke. Time has come now to have independent regulators to stop these clubs from having the power base. Enough is enough.”

In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel described how in order to become successful in business, one must not simply thrive in competition... but eliminate competition and become a monopoly. A very dangerous notion that only proves that unrestrained capitalism is, in fact, the enemy of free trade and competition.



Anyway... this is exactly what those clubs are trying to do, eliminate competition, become a monopoly, make all the other clubs irrelevant, and maximise their profits.



A European Super League marks the death of continental football, of competition, of new clubs rising and old clubs declining, and so on. Basically, it takes the life out of football."

I would guess like a Cancer they planned to cream all the big European clubs to a new league. Which would monopolise all money, tv and fans to those clubs without any care for smaller clubs or real competition and the meritocracy of the game. Problem is without the fans coming too it won’t work. What a mess. Yes maybe things need modernised but this is a brutal hammer blow if it occurs to the competition in the middle of a pandemic. I suspect part of it is keeping their revenues coming by monopolising TV money as bums on seats looks to be at risk of COVID restrictions. I know revenues are down but some solidarity with the fans please!"

Just have a look in European Basketball. The moment they started a similar project -the Euroleague - all national championships lost their value, people lost their interest because there was no point in watching a championship. A team can win the league and they won't be able to participate in the Euroleague.
Hell, in Greece Olympiacos got relegated (by choice) and they are still in the Euroleague.
Bottom line, if that thing goes forward, forget the national championships as you know them.

The local leagues are threatening to ban them which is siding with UEFA/FIFA. In all fairness FIFA and UEFA are not really the benchmark for righteousness. UEFA cannot even implement Financial Fair Play or rid the game of racism. However, in the end they will find a compromise. Let’s face it it’s very similar to the Financial crisis where some Organizations were tagged as too big to fail. Without these clubs CL and the leagues will loose the revenue they need to sustain their own survival. Hoping for the best as a football fan."

Are you guys seriously expecting businessman like the owner of big clubs going to sit down and watch their money losing ? Club like Arsenal would sell their best players and other clubs could be like that too. Do your research, your club is going to fill bankruptcy before you even know it. Not everybody is fking PSG."

If Sky and BT Sports bid for the broadcast rights then their outrage will be meaningless. This what happens when you allow American businessmen to take ownership of our clubs. It's just a money making machine to them. In the 50s a group of top tennis players turned professional. They were then barred from all major tournaments like Wimbledon and were ineligible for Davis Cup selection. Let's hope the various national associations plus EUFA and FIFA refuse to sanction this enterprise and then render these clubs and their players ineligible for any football other than their own money making enterprise."

As a fan, it will be more exciting to see only the best of the best play each other than watching them play Club Brugge or Rennes or something in ""Europe's biggest competition"". And for all you blaming clubs for being greedy, why do you think UEFA are threatening a ban? They know their ad revenues will drastically drop if the best clubs play in a much better and much more watched competition. So do all the domestic leagues. They'll go dirt poor without their best clubs. Some things do need to be changed, I agree that clubs shouldn't have permanent positions in the Super League, especially clubs such as arsenal who haven't even qualified for the ucl in years. But overall, I don't think the idea is bad.
After all, if the idea does go through then MARK MY WORDS, there's no way the Premier League will ban their biggest 6 clubs from playing in the domestic league. Same goes for the other leagues."

shaunhalliwell5766,2021-04-19T09:03:55Z,0,"Well if we are going to talk about greed in the game, let's not just attack the club owners for greed! Let's talk about greed in all parts of the game involving players and agents! Let's talk about the fact that that Lionel Messi for all his talents and the profits for Barcelona through shirt sales also contributed to the financial mess of Barcelona inadvertently! His obscene wages meant that every playing member of Barcelona's squad and agents upped their demands as well! A situation where Barcelona are over a billion euros in debt!  So while the owners are greedy, the greed goes all the way down the line! Of course Neville and Keane, not my favourite players by any stretch won't mention the greed of the players because that's ok!  The hunt for trophies by all clubs, but especially the big ones are exactly why the club owners want to cut and run and grab all the spoils to keep up their ever increasing demands by supporters! That's why we get stupid sums of money for blatantly average players!
So shine a light on all the greed in the game! Let's think about subjects such as a maximum celling of transfer money and players wages! Let's talk about the sums of money some of these agents are getting and let's think about a small percentage of each transfer being levied to help the clubs in the lower divisions!  Don't just shine a light on the club owners! I hope this European Super League fails because ultimately every club however big or small deserves the dream of playing against the top sides in Europe but let's get all greed  from the game and more help for the smaller clubs so that we don't have more Macclesfields in future!"

Both organizations are corrupt and if fifa cared about people they would cancel the qatar world Cup with its human rights abuses but the commercial pull is too great. Don't see how people are so surprised or acting like this is the final straw - this is the commercialization of football and is little different to now where the super rich owners get their clubs success. Nobody has the moral high ground here, they are just following the money which is the direction it has been going.

Football shouldn't be fixated on money. The players who play are paid to play, but that is not the goal but football is how to achieve maximum results and present a beautiful game to the audience. It will ruin football because with the European Super League, many leagues are no longer interesting to watch. Especially with FIFA's policy which states that players who play in this league cannot defend their respective national teams which will interfere with national events. Especially the World Cup. We will no longer be interested in waiting every 4 years to watch the World Cup, because of what? Because all football fans will focus on the European Super League which brings together all the big teams in Europe. This will destroy the football ecosystem. Players who are already rich will get richer and those with less salary will be excluded.

Look around Europe and you see leagues that are won by the same 1 or 2 teams every year. Norwich just got promoted back to the Premier League. Great achievement. Norwich will NEVER win the league. Teams like Everton and West Ham already can't compete with the big clubs. Okay, people might point to Leicester winning the league, but when was the last time before that when a smaller club won it? Blackburn in 95. And if your team is below the Premier League, what can you even hope to achieve?

Football is already dominated by money*, I don't understand why the fans of the smaller clubs just accepted this for the last 20 years.

The only way to fix football is equally share out all revenue earned by the league across all teams, and implement a salary cap. Then you have a competition that anybody can win. But this will never happen.

* And by the way, Sky Sports LOVE the money. Just look at transfer deadline day. As soon as Sky Sports are involved in this super league, selling matches on Pay Per View, they will say its the best league in the world."

These clubs should all be bigger than their owners greed, and if it takes us all pretending like these clubs no longer exist so be it!! If this happens, a boycott needs to happen to stand together as REAL football fans!"

Respect the fans.

sassykeys2502,2021-04-19T08:31:02Z,0,"This is how the great reset affects fans. Football clubs breakaway to a billionaire league, while the true fans are treated as serfs and replaced by elitists who will actually be able to afford to watch these games in the stadium. The fans can stay at home and watch on their tv. This is ripping the remnants of the soul out of the game and out of the country to be honest. Even if fans tried to boycott, that's just the small picture as far as the rich owners are concerned. The big picture is the worldwide viewership. Think countries such as China who are going to be the economic powerhouse. Their coverage will be more loyal to appeasing those countries and regimes as opposed to the people at home. Look at what's happened to the NBA and MLB.

Gary Neville is right. The only way out of this is if the people in this country and the real football fans wrestle back control of their clubs. In Germany clubs by law have to be majority owned by fans. They produce great young players and look out for the interests of their own domestic game. The warning signs have been evident in England for a while with the lack of homegrown players at the top clubs. And it's not that it's unattainable to do this. Look at Man United under Fergie, the Barca squad from around 2008-2012 and even the Ajax side from a couple years ago. It's more expedient to be able to buy talent. It's difficult to grow it. Maybe it's not as cost effective if you're a big club, but it has consequences for your homegrown talent if they're not prioritised. Hey I went off topic."

Perhaps they'll be able to sell the competition around the rest of the world but I can see fans in Europe cancelling their subscriptions to watch it. The Prem is viewed around the globe because of it's breakneck speed and excitement and not, necessarily, for the high level of technical ability. There are better leagues technically but they're not as popular with viewers.


 



I think UEFA, The F.A., Premier League and other leagues should stick to their guns and kick the teams and players out of their competitions. Also make it clear that the clubs would have to re-join in the lower divisions and work their way up again. Stand up to these clubs who believe they have all the power because of their financial muscle.



 


Ultimately the money in football comes from the fans. If nobody goes to games, buys shirts, pays for TV subscriptions then the money will dry up and it will become an unattractive prospect for sponsors. If it was my club I'd be giving up my season ticket, cancelling my TV subscriptions to watch them and going to watch a local side instead. Frankly the greedy imposters are welcome to their Sterile 'Product'. Count me out."

pawelzietek,2021-04-19T08:22:54Z,0,"I am not against a concept of a European Super League...

However I would only celebrate it if it's merit based and any club could potentially join it. I would say ok to a 4-5 division European League, where 1st division would replace the Champions League, 2nd Europa League, etc. Each season bottom 5-6 teams would go down, replaced by top teams from the lower divisions. The last division would be 3x20 teams groups with bottom 8-10 from each being replaced by winners and runner-ups of national leagues or similar and top 2 fighting to move up.

In the form that is being proposed - I am with Gary Neville here, punish these teams as hard as possible."

Talking nice about BUY-EARN MUNICH when year after year they buy out all the best players in Germany. Business is business. Ya'll allowed UEFA and FIFA to control football all these years, with their fake Champions League round draws. Talk about VAR in England and what penalties referees face for their part in destroying dreams.

Again, maybe I don't fully understand but as far as I see, these clubs will still exist and the beautiful game will still be played. Ok so if the ""big six"" stop competing in the PL how does that stop football?

Why threaten these clubs so harshly just because they want more control over revenue that they generate?

These teams are the reason UEFA earns so much money year after year. Are they being compensated enough? Does UEFA give enough money back to clubs that are making them filthy rich?

These things have to fall apart to be rebuilt better. Football was already suffering because of corruption and greed. This is just natural progression."

Just put the words ""a different set of"" in front of money and billionaires every time Gary throws sardines off his trawler for the Twitter trolls. How does this hurt competition? If it happens, it will create bigger TV revenues that will help the smaller clubs eventually....who NEVER ACTUALLY WIN ANYTHING EVER ANYWAYS THANKS TO THE CURRENT MODEL! It will actually IMPROVE competition too, at least when it comes to the big teams, ie. the ones that 99% of the world watches. The current system has allowed for all types of money and corruption over the last few decades. HELL! You're all defending UEFA and FIFA?!?! What's next, the Olympics? This sport is more corporate than ANY in America too. Stop deluding yourself with your precious image of this business....err, I mean sport. Don't believe me, go check your jersey for your latest sponsor or your old one for your last corporate whore job. Just because this precious archaic business model is under attack, doesn't mean you all have to be pawns and gobble up every bit of nonsense Gary and HIS BILLIONAIRE BACKERS who put him on TV toss on you. Honestly, he hasn't been right about anything for years. These are also the talking heads that said the Glazers would bankrupt United in months....then years....now going on decades. The guy changes his tune week to week to perform for his Twitter legion. He stopped being serious after the fourth time he predicted Ole out and LFC to win everything this year. Honestly, It's embarrassing listening/reading this drove of store-bought regurgitated unoriginal nonsense. It's shocking how easy it is for the scared billionaire media world to control the lot of you. Like....way too easy."

U remember fifa tried to ban indian super league what happened???? Nothing.  EPL is the only powerfull of all the league this is the only way to take the power away from them. And about banning player from representing country, then what do u expect Burney English players to represent England or what. Maybe u didn't read but the 12 clubs wants to stay in domestic league. ""An August start with clubs participating in two groups of 10, playing home and away fixtures, with the top three in each group automatically qualifying for the quarter finals. Teams finishing fourth and fifth will then compete in a two-legged play-off for the remaining quarter-final positions. A two-leg knockout format will be used to reach the final at the end of May, which will be staged as a single fixture at a neutral venue."" So clearly football fans should not jump into conclusion so easily what they here in media special sky & bt they are bullshit. Why does uefa allow 2-3-4 teams to complete in champions league from one country and only 1-2 teams from some other countries. Why does preseason friendly is allowed or why does club world cup is allowed by uefa. Why stupid cup competition are played. I don't understand it's such a mesh😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"

You already have a system that protects big teams

make the winners of each league in Europes structure get automatic entry to the champions league, none of this 2nd and 3rd & 4th into champions league

the fact this has been happening is exactly why these teams think they can go and create their own super league, because the TV channels already favour them, the advertisers already favour them

2nd, 3rd & 4th in a EPL league should not be entitled to Champions league football at the expense of winners of smaller leagues such as Belgian or Scottish leagues, the reason why the gap is widening in the big 4 leagues and the rest of European leagues is because the money is being funnelled into the English, German, Spanish & Italian leagues through multiple places in champions league

It is pure greed going against all our history and traditions. This is an insult to the fans who give these clubs money. I blame it on billionaire owners and American sports bullshit.
paddyoboyle4977,2021-04-19T07:56:51Z,0,The multimillionaire Gary Neville complaining about clubs being greedy.  Irony!  If you apply his philosophy to himself he'd still be playing for his schoolboy team.....as would everyone.  He moved to Man Utd to play at the level he deserved in the best league to show off his skills and of course to make a load of money.  So when Man Utd consider doing the same it is disgraceful...... The level of intelligence in Sky Sports punditry is depressing.  RTE is much better.  Listen to someone like Richie Sadlier talking about complex topics like this in a measured approach......

This is shocking and it's great to see the universal backlash. I wouldn't be surprised to see fans burning their shirts if this goes ahead. I'm already giving the WC a miss due to all the corruption and slavery involved. Looks like I might have to find a new club while I'm at it. Kudos to G. Neville for such an impassioned speech.

""The game belongs to the people"" that's cute and all, but the reality is that these clubs are businesses in a multi million $$$ market and if they don't protect their interests then they may end up regretting it in the future. These teams (exception of Tottenham tbh) realize that they are the ones that bring interests to the champions league, yet they're not getting the split of the pie they feel they deserve. This new league will soon be joined by Bayern, Dortmund and PSG to make it 15 teams, and they'll invite 5 more to be announced. 

You want to kick those teams out of UEFA and FIFA competitions? Sure have a premier league w/o Liverpool, United, Chelsea, Arsenal or City... good luck selling that product to the rest of the world. Same goes for the rest of the leagues. Matter of fact kick Chelsea, Madrid, City and PSG out the champions league right now and name Porto the Champions lol. UEFA and FIFA are shitting their pants because they are about to lose their jobs and power and they're asking all the leagues and federations to stand up against this new project. I could see the Ajax, Porto, Benfica, Galatasaray etc complain and worry, but what does a Man U fan have to worry about? They'll get to watch their club play against the best teams in the world. 

This will affect our leagues as far as come March some clubs may have nothing to play for if they're mid table, making the leagues more boring, but that's where I think UEFA can still exist and host their Europa League or w/e it's called these days."

Almost like the WWE of football. What`s wrong with this? If they still compete in all other leagues and it also helps other clubs financially, what is wrong with this? I don`t support any club but always look forward to the world cup or european cup as I can see the best teams out there compete.

SuperBitsandBob,2021-04-19T07:26:44Z,0,"Heavy dose of hypocrisy here talking about greed. People working for a company like Sky who charge crazy amounts to watch football getting paid a fortune no doubt. The league isn't fair at the moment. Holding up a club like Leicester winning the league once in a blue moon isn't competitive. Neither is stating you want Man Utd to be richer and win everything. Is it competitive if a billionaire comes in and takes a mid table team to the top 4? It makes the top 4 more competitive but is it fair on clubs that don't have that billionaire? That mid table club would still be a mid table club without someone bringing in their ""greed"". Lots of contradictions in all this reporting."

kevinpillay6103,2021-04-19T07:06:48Z,0,The PL should have seen this coming when they started to approve US and other foreign owners buying the biggest clubs in England.  THE US owners all own franchisees in the US and know that an elite system means they make lots more money and know they wont lose out.   Did they think that these owners had the clubs history and interests at heart.   I thought was great when they decided not approve Saudi's buying Newcastle as their leaders are atrocious and involved in murder etc but they should have put rules in place a long time when approving American ownership knowing how they run the franchises in the US.  The sad part is if this goes ahead I think a time people would accept it as the league's wonr be same anymore and football would hard to stomach and tv money etc would be reduced.  Dont be mistaken German and French giants want to be included but its just the rules of German football has fans in control of ownership so Bayern will look to find a way around that.  They want 15 teams in this so will target Bayen; Dortmund maybe and PSG.  So whilst this is disgusting and absolutely out of order and would love for these clubs to be expelled I feel power has been given to them a long time ago by not enough regulations when it came to ownership etc.

saucyisawesome,2021-04-19T06:54:13Z,0,I love it. This will make the league more fair since  all the league has been a no fair league in the first place. It’s always the team with the most money that never gets relegated anyways. If there was a salary cap then I’d believe all the hate that comes from it but since there’s no salary cap then I say go with the super league. It’s only fair. I always see the same teams with money in the top 10 over and over. I don’t blame super league. I blame all the leagues or fifa for not having salary cap. We always see all the attractive players in one team. Where’s the competition in that? If there was a salary cap then we’d see the likes of Mbappe to West Brom or some club and make that club more attractive to watch mostly because of him. Vote for Salary Cap. It will do good for all the leagues and clubs since it will have a trickle down effect. Which would make all team attractive to watch instead of the same big teams over and over.

There was reform every year with groups shifting for more and more power creating uncompetitive structures guaranteeing playoff places for certain regions among teams from that region. You do not want this. It will spoil football. SA rugby is ruined because of this

These psychopathic owners don’t share the same values, principles and morals as the average working class fan.

Because these clubs are the prominent clubs represented in the domestic and international european leagues, it will also be a huge loss if these clubs are absent (or banned as some governing bodies has stated) from these leagues. These founding clubs know the governing bodies simply CANNOT afford to not have these teams competing in the normal leagues like the EPL. This is criminal manipulation."

I don't understand people who don't support their local teams. The English game would be so much better if people supported where they are from i.e not supporting Man United when you're from Devon.

Instead of throwing these 12 clubs (6 from the EPL) under the bus - maybe FA need to assess what have they done to their own domestic league, this is what you get when you run your domestic league like a JOKE. Week in Week out - your referees couldn't even get the RULES right. EPL VAR is a disgrace, officiating like a clown. why would the Top 6 put up with your shambolic system. UEFA is no better, with their dirty laundry - RIgged matches where odd calls being made in CL year in year out, ""Financial"" Fair Play and only gave 10 match ban for Racially Abusing other player - It's a Joke!"

In the end, it’s a money transaction for these people in power. Greed can be a disease if you allow it. Issue with ownership is that once they get more, they want more. It’d be dope if they simply created the ‘Super League’ as just another major competition minus the breakaway. They could’ve worked that out. It’s the “breakaway” that’s devastating the world."

I believe these clubs should get a bigger piece of the pie as they are the reason for us wanting to see the best perform. They are the once scouting for CR7 and Messi. Uefa and there board members are not breaking a sweat to scout for players. Then also what if a super league ticket is cheaper. Let's thinks about this.

Benfica  and FC Porto have more history  in the Champions League then lets say Tottenham . I can't believe Real Madrid and Barca accepted to be part of this, I guess money talks! What bullshit! Who wants to see a football league where you know the founding clubs will never be relegated just because? Football is about fair competition,  where the  best performers , the champions , move up because of merit and the lowest performers move down! It's a fair system , everyone plays against everyone else, everyone has a shot at being the champion! 
Imagine if someone came up wih an idea and do that in professional boxing? Pick the top 20 richest promotors and let them and their boxers fight eachother only. No one else outside of the ""Club""  will have  a shot at one of  those guys? What a stupid , unfair and selfish idea! How can you call yourself the true champion ? We the fans and lovers of sports and competition want fairness and the competiton open for all according to merit, not bank account of the owners! 
I hope all football fans around europe and around the world stand up and let their opinions known! People, the fans have paid with their money for tickets for football matches to see their club play! Fans money , passion , support and love built the Clubs! I do think however that there are many things that FIFA and UEFA need to do , because the way it is right now could be improved! Salaries of players are just insanly disproportionate, agents fees are too high as well, sponsors are getting greedy , players will soon be wearing a brand stamped on their foreads if they are not careful!   Business partners are welcome, we need them,  but this money thing is destroying the spirit of the game and of sport competition in general. Maybe a Super League could be created by joining both the Champions League and Europa League into to one big, giant 'Super' competition , divided in groups , a little like the Europa Nations League, with the top teams ranked in the higher group according to merit and the lowest ranked at the bottom, but where there's promotion and relegation from every group. At least it would be open and fair to all! Fiorentino Perez & Co...shame on YOU!"

A Leicester miracle could still happen just to win the league, and not like a Leicester could become a European regular and win it someday anyways, it will always be the royalties that compete in the last stages. It is basically just a reform against UEFA more than anything,  not like UEFA is known for being the cleanest organization, and with the sketchy FFP stuff. Yes it will be more Elitist stopping the cyclical downfalls for the ""elite clubs"" and clubs like Arsenal being in it makes no sense but it's not like ""destroying football""."

I would deduct points and refuse registration in any league in the UK. Wonder how many players would stay at their clubs knowing they couldn't represent their country at World Cups and the like. Reminds me a lot of World Series Cricket and the only real outcome from that was a stuffed game. Time for a level playing field. Salary caps and draft processes would prevent money dominating. If that were to eventuate the Yanks, the Middle eastern owners and the oil barons wouldn't be seen for dust and that can't be a bad thing for the game."

I support the idea as long as they play in their domestic leagues but fifa and uefa moralling clubs is a joke. Their main sponsor is the Russian state now. Atleast these clubs are honest about it. Uefa never cared about grass roots football and the money that these clubs generate is enormous and that is taken up by uefa and then given back so very little. I get it that football should not be this money oriented but when our club is brought by a oil rich nation that pours money into to the club we seem to not mind it do we. Then what's wrong with getting the money that you generate.

In the meantime smaller clubs Leicester City and West Ham United  are within champions league qualification.

Greedy people want to destroy all that competition. I am a Man United fan and have not been happy since Sir Alex left as head coach, So the big money teams of England can play rubbish and not risk anything? Glazers et al are idiots. If competition is killed the big teams will lose fans. I want to see Manchester United qualify for champions league by beating small teams like it did with Burnley yesterday as well as big teams like it beat Man City and Tottenham recently.

If Manchester United start playing rubbish and are bottom of the big six in Englang as well as bottom of everything else they remain in the “Super league”? Are these guys crazy.?This “Super league” without any chance of relegation would face droping standards and lose fans and money. The greedy idiots do not think beyond their noses!"

Now they are complaining about greedy owners who choose instead to use the clubs as tools to fill their own coffers.

From the vid their points were mainly for the local fans which is completely understandable but these clubs have grown bigger then their local community. As a fan who can never attend games in person, I don’t feel the connection of local derbies or culture unfortunately.

Makainternational,2021-04-19T04:06:33Z,0,"I agree with Gary Neville completely. It is an absolute disgrace. We are supposed to be living in what we call a post-capitalist era. Slowly moving towards Corporate social responsibility, sustainability, diversity, equality and inclusion. Ever since the financial peril of 2008, very very slowly we have moved to a better place. However, the mentality of people still living in a bubble remains and they have money, power and Influence. They still want to make sure the rich get richer and poor get poorer. The capitalist system breeds greed. It damages lives, the environment, communities, creates poverty, inequality and even the sport we love gets affected. It is a cancer that rips through everything. I do believe people should make money, but how much does one really need?"

Sending last 8 teams from each one the following year to UEFA Super League, 16 teams in total. So 48+48+16=112 teams and more countries can taste play european football.

seven92023,2021-04-19T03:54:29Z,0,"Most people are afraid of big change. And no one wants to lose power and money. The FA knows if the big teams go, they will lose power and money. The EPL, La Liga and Serie A will be nothing without the big teams. The Super League will offer competition of the biggest clubs. I remember when people were against the Champions League in the early 90s. Nobody is against that now when 3-4 teams from the top leagues make it there. It used to be only the champions. If UEFA is not gonna create a better Champions League then the clubs have every right to seek a creation of their own competition. Who wouldn't want to watch the best teams and players play against each other year around regularly? I rather watch that than big club vs bottom club. 
And they want to ban players from these clubs to play from their national teams? Go ahead, let's see how interesting then the Euros and World Cups will be. 
The reality is that the big clubs with the best players have the leverage. They talk about this being motivated by greed. There is greed on the side of FAs too. It's fight for power on both sides."

I remember skipping college classes with my bro to watch MU and LFC matches because they came on during class. They are great memories. But that was 11 years ago. Where the F*** do these clubs get off thinking that they are so special that they should just break off and play one another? My club has been an absolute disaster for the past 10 years. 

These clubs must be tired of getting embarrassed by ""bottom"" clubs and having their ""high Holy names"" tarnished by the fact they can't just dominate the leagues they play in straight away like they used to.

No opportunity to get upstaged if you create your own members only club and keep the upcoming teams out. These clubs have their noses so high in the air they might just suffocate from lack of oxygen... And with the choice they all have made...they might just deserve it."

The super league would form a new path for conduction football competitions without a 3rd party. Don’t be fooled by the media. There’s a reason they all agree on something for once.

Kills competition even more and devalues the EPL. Punish for the attempt to do so!  

OR, they dont expect it to go ahead and just look forward to gaining some form of compromise they wouldn't otherwise of had. A grab plain and simple. Again, punish for the attempt to do so!

RuariT,2021-04-19T03:18:50Z,1,"So why is this bad? they stay in their domestic league and its just 
competition against the monopoly of uefa and fifa. Which they are trying
 to keep by banning them from the world cup. And if you are all about 
tradition. The premier league was formed in 1992 when they BROKEAWAY 
from the football league and changed it so small grass root clubs didnt 
get money anymore and it was only split between the premier league. The 
PREM was anti-grassroots lmao. Embarrasing. Also rupert murdoch who owns
 big news paper sites and got the tv deal for the prem is the one who 
use to run sky so this is all just THESE people being greedy at some

Vict0r1984,2021-04-19T02:44:31Z,2,"As an Eastern European football fan, the way I see this is capitalism hitting the final nail in football's coffin. It's like what happened to my nation's economy when I was a child in the 1990s: they privatized everything and millions were left jobless and in poverty because of an elite group of oligarchs that didn't care about working people or the welfare of their country and just wanted to get richer at everyone else's expense, only this time the working people are the fans, the oligarchs are the billionaire owners of these top clubs and the bankrupted privatized states are the national leagues... It's disgusting! 

Football was already very commercial and has a bit of a rich cartel with a monopoly on talent at the top of the best 5 European leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France respectively) that dominates the Champions league, (That's the reason why after Porto's 2004 miracle you rarely saw the likes of Porto, Ajax, Red Star Belgrade or even Steaua Bucharest from my home country back in 86' pick up the trophy - whenever there are talented players in b-tier leagues they get bought by rich clubs from the top 4 leagues or by PSG before they could bring glory to clubs from smaller footballing nations...) but this would kill the dream even for the likes of Leicester or Atalanta, who play in some of the best leagues in the world! 

This is orders of magnitude worse than any degree of commercialisation before it - it's adopting the soulless capitalist MLS American model at the top of European football (the 15 founding teams can never even be relegated from this ""super league"", just like all MLS clubs...), and honestly just paves the way even more towards the surveillance-based stateless free market dystopia we are already headed for as a society. This is cyberpunk, but without the glitz and with all the shitty tyranny of corporations over your life, so we should all fight it and oppose it! 

If you support any of these clubs, organize as fans and collectively stop attending games, drop season tickets and cancel memberships! Make it hurt with your collective bargaining power in the only place where you can hurt them - money - and make it very clear you are doing this unless they back out of this outrageous project! I'm only an immigrant to Britain and I hardly attended any Premier League or UEFA games as they are expensive, but especially because of that I realize how powerful dedicated fans can be if they would act collectively (as a union of sorts if you like), not as disgruntled individuals, and my hopes are with you to stop this from happening!"

andreberment3845,2021-04-19T02:38:52Z,1,"from my humble understanding, Gary and co. is misleading the public and boosting UEFA ego/stance. I don't think I want to see this super league but for entirely diff reasons to what I just heard.
the 12 clubs aren't leaving their local leagues or turning their backs on the grassroots of their communities, what they want to do is create a separate league from UEFA ( champions league ) and play in their own league but they would still play in their own leagues on weekends.
UEFA's issue is the billions they would lose because if the ""super league"" games are being played mid-week at the same times as CL they will lose $$$. so they contacted the local leagues to pressure the 12 teams and its the leagues who are threatening to kick the teams out of their leagues if they decide to not play in UEFA CL. 
so the local leagues EPL La Liga Serie A would still continue to run as per usual with the usual teams, it's just those 12 teams would only be competing for the league titles, not CL spots as they would be in their own ""super league"". 
So this is really misleading reporting that's been going on i think. if I'm wrong then I just wasted a lot of peoples time who read all this, but that's my understanding of the situation after some little research."

robjohnson8214,2021-04-19T02:23:55Z,0,"I'm an American and started playing socc...er...futbol in 2000 when i was in my early 30s.  From day 1 was absolutely hooked.  Came across a Premier League game one evening while randomly channel surfing (Leeds v Arsenal if I recall) on a fairly obscure cable and couldn't get enough.  The passion, integrity, and sheer beauty of the competition was exactly what American sports USED to before greed completely took over.  We had a nice socc....er futbol pub in Seattle, The George and Dragon, and I'd go and watch with the English expats and ask and learn about the sport.  Was a complete joy.  I knew every team, every player, even the bench players.  I was an ardent fan of the EPL for about 10 yrs until about 2010.  

Sadly, I've seen the game deteriorate from greed and marketing similar to the NFL, MLB, and NBA (sorry NHL never watched).  Today I barely watch a game.  A bunch of mercenaries with no allegiance and no passion.  It makes me sad to think that my years of enjoyment and fanship from across the pond contributed to the sport.   

This Super League is all that's wrong with sports.  I'm out."

thesoultwins72,2021-04-19T02:22:58Z,0,"I have nothing but the deepest admiration and respect for Gary Neville and his impassioned beliefs - his experience and knowledge of football [and at almost at every level] should perhaps be put to better use than simply as a pundit? But I am a little bit bemused as to why the public [and political] outcry against the obscene greed of these 'big clubs' and their fabulously wealthy owners is not viewed in the same manner as what is happening in the world as a whole?
With an estimated global population of almost 8 billion people - 6 billion of us live in abject poverty. In Asia, there are countries such as Cambodia where 66% of the people live on less than US$1 per day - and 38% of them live on less than 50 cents a day! Meanwhile, many of the world's billionaires have seen an INCREASE in their personal wealth by an average of 44% during this terrible pandemic. [ie: Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, has seen his net worth increase by over US$20 billion in the last 4 months alone]. 
At the same time, the pandemic has also led to an additional 120 million people being forced into even greater depths of poverty - a figure that is expected to rise to 150 million by the end of 2021. And almost 50% of those affected are children. Yet nearly all of the world's richest people - the so-called 'One-percenters' - have largely created their huge wealth through their utter contempt for the wellbeing of the vast majority of us and even worse, to the detriment of our planet's fragile eco-system.  
Yes there are some 'good' people out there [eg: Rutger Bregman, Greta Thunberg, Dr Jane Goodall, Sir David Attenborough etc] who are challenging this totally iniquitous and disgraceful situation. But isn't about time that we all - football fans included - take a much tougher stance against this utterly self-serving and ruthlessly greedy faction within society?"

Same with any type of entertainment, even YouTube where the vloggers be like ""we love you guys"", lol they don't love you, they just love how you bring them a revenue, 99% don't give a f about you, I don't even blame them as they doing their hustle.

1979 is when I began supporting MUFC. This is a kick in the guts. Do I have to change my MUFC tattoo to RIP MUFC 2021? 

How it is European if most of Europe's clubs are not in it and can not qualify? How is it Super if three English clubs that have never won a European Cup are in it?

UEFA and the like have said participating clubs will be banned from all competitions, while players will be banned from representing their countries. I hope they stick to their guns. Supporters also need to be very vocal and make this super league idea so toxic that the branding is irreversibly damaged. 

Then football finance reform needs to be seriously looked at and implemented right. It is so much more than just a business. German model now! (or something that achieves the same goal, or better, so big money can not railroad our clubs into Hollywood hype sport franchises etc).

It could be massive damage to football, players, and supporters. Big money grabbing at all the TV revenue etc. 

Two years down the road it will happen again? Not if The league and governing bodies make clubs sign binding agreements to never sign up for break away leagues.They can not compete in any competition if they refuse to make that commitment.  It they are caught conspiring like this, they get marched though the traitors' gate at the tower for betraying millions of football supporters. Some would call for the return of the axe. I'd settle for the pillory and rotten tomatoes - one tomato for every seat in the stadium of the club they betrayed."

Most of the clubs are in financial ruins due to covid but the uefa nor any one has supported them so its right they want a bigger portion to sustain themselves.

craigbeckley2710,2021-04-19T01:40:53Z,0,"It's very easy to sit here and say that this is a shambles, etc. However, when you've invested hundreds of millions of pounds into something, you want to do everything you can to secure that investment and ensure it doesn't tank (i.e. a big club getting relegated). Let's face it, the gap between the mid-table teams and the top teams (asides from one or two like Man City) is decreasing... Small clubs now have access to the best training facilities, fitness and nutrition coaches, and great football managers, etc. What separates them from the top, top teams might only be one or two generational talents. 
Do I like this? No. But, you can't expect the money to keep increasing - the stakes getting higher and higher and higher - and the owners with the most to lose to not want to secure their investment. Because, whilst we like the idea of a small club getting to the top, we are only thinking about that from the perspective of clubs with nothing having everything to gain... but we don't think about how clubs at the top have everything to lose and, actually, not much to gain from their positions."

maldini3184,2021-04-19T01:37:13Z,1,The Super League is a great idea. The problem is no relegation or promotion so a team like Leicester who has progressed immensely in recent years have no chance of playing in it. Lets be honest when UEFA revamped the CL in the early 90s by having more than one team from the top leagues and calling it the Champions league that is where this idea is coming from. Celtic haven't played in the group stages for a while now yet Tottenham was playing the final only 3 years ago having not won a league title in ages.

The 15 founding clubs wouldn’t be able to be relegated, but there would still be 5 places for relegation and promotion. The Leicester story could still happen. Imagine the stories of a smaller club winning the premier league and being able to play in the gold standard super league, playing the biggest clubs in the world week in week out. 

It’s still not a good idea, because the champions league does this already and doesn’t guarantee the richest clubs permanency. However, if they are using this just to force uefa to change the format to a more league like competition as opposed to a knockout comp, then that’s actually a good idea. Their format of the 2 groups of 10 is interesting. That said, it’s an absolute joke that they think they have the right to stay in the biggest league regardless of their performance"

dwaynelincoln9749,2021-04-19T01:30:03Z,0,"Gary Neville is spot on. I don't mind the creation of a new tournament that involves the top teams in Europe.  However, this superleague, where the wealthier teams breakaway and permanently compete against each other just for making more money,, is not the way. It destroys fair competition and makes the left-behind teams worsed off. This superleague would only work if it had a qualification system e.g. the top two teams of the main leagues qualified and in the next season, they compete in this league (I've always wanted to know how liverpool would perform if they played in the Bundesliga and this would sort of approximate it) to figure out who truly is the best and this process repeats. However, without any qualification process, this idea is ridiculous and betrayal to football community as a whole. Money for oneself should not be the only way success is measured in the sports industry in general. The fact that Arsenal is doing this is embarrassing.  They are not even a big club yet because they have the wealth they think that automatically makes them despite not winning anything significant in almost 20 years. Kudos to PSG and Bayern for not approving this."

He's a proper footballing man for all the right reasons and it's spot on how he has reacted and what he has said. Thinking about the roots of Football, from the best clubs in the Premier League, down to grass roots football throughout this country, Gary and Micha are 100% correct and right to say this is disgusting. These owners - they are a disgrace and at times like this, I am glad my club is owned by a local family and do actually care about the whole club and it's place in it's community. Yes, we may be pretty dire in terms of performance, but Stoke City are a community club and I am glad to be under the radar. Money makes money makes greed - when will these clowns be happy?

beast0blood,2021-04-19T00:29:34Z,1,"Now that the plans have been announced and everyone on BT and Sky are against it, let's see the bosses above the presenters/pundits refuse to broadcast this Super League. 

If that happens (along with the refusal from the Premier League and ultimately FIFA to recognise it - i.e. not allowing the teams to play domestically as well) is the only thing that will stop this ESL going ahead.

Edit: Just to clarify, I have NO faith in BT and especially Sky (given that they don't show Champions league football) to take the moral high ground here and refuse to engage with it. Sadly, I don't even see the Premier League & FA actually kicking the 6 teams out of the league either (or deducting them points) as they're too afraid of the fallout. However, if the Prem, FA and FIFA are serious about their anti Super League stance, this is the only way to show it. 

Neville's absolutely right, the 6 clubs should have their points removed and the league titles/positions revoked in favour of the 14 other clubs."

FaizanAli-cj9el,2021-04-18T23:59:16Z,3,As a lifelong Manchester United supporter I have loved my club dearly through the highs and lows... from winning the treble in 99’ and winning the Premier League 3x in a row including winning the double in 2008 to losing the Barclays Premier League to local rivals in the final minute of the season in 2012 and losing in Champions League finals against Barcelona... I never in my lifetime thought I would lose my love for this club regardless of the situation but today I can honestly say with a broken heart that I am absolutely ashamed to be a supporter of Manchester United as it has turned into a club which can so easily dispose of its history and loyal supporters for extra profit and greed... I never thought I would lose my love for football especially during a time like this when football is the only thing getting us through a global crisis... shame on the Glazers and the owners of the other clubs who have also decided to join this bullshit league... you should all die and hang ur heads in shame after making such a shambolic statement 💔💔 AS FANS WE NEED TO TRY OUR BEST AND VOICE OUR OPINIONS TO STAND AGAINST SUCH A DISGUSTING AND GREEDY ACT 😢💯

I’m so sick of these donuts buying the vast majority, if not all of, football clubs then exploiting them not for the club’s benefit, not for the benefit of the fans in a pandemic and global crisis but  rather, their own.

I’m not sure what to do now. Do I support another club, which is an act so shameful as a fan? Do I just stop watching football in general? I’m so confused. The sport I’ve loved for so long is just dead. Money’s killed it. These higher-ups need to stop acting like a bunch of greedy yes-men and start acting like *human beings.*"

Up until that point, we were on a downward trend and eventually trading sideways, like we're seeing now. It wasn't a technical breakout that drove Bitcoin to new highs in February, it was more fundamental news of adoption by major institutions. We need to see more of that if we're going to repeat the growth that we saw last month.

1) Neither the French and German clubs will join this league as they could be ejected from their own national leagues and possibly dissolved by sanction.
2) Very few TVs will buy the rights to broadcast (except possibly in the countries of rebel clubs ...) and they risk a general boycott.
3) Some players from these clubs might ask to leave out of dissatisfaction and also others might not want to join these clubs.
4) I think that a lot of fans of these clubs will show their opposition and will not go to see these matches ...
5) If despite everything, this new competition is born, UEFA must immediately ban these clubs for at least 20 years for the CL (slightly less wealthy clubs in these countries will benefit from this and that's good).

What I can say is that if I was a fan of one of these clubs I would be furious and ashamed of these owners ..."

jamesryan1147,2021-04-18T23:36:00Z,0,"When SKY were willing to charge fans 14 pounds per game recently, Gary Neville, who is an employee of SKY, didn't resign in protest. No way!!! Even though I do not want a European Super League, the hyprocisy of Gary is mindblowing. Just coz his employers at SKY run the Premier League he's now incensed by the greed in the game & the moneymen. Where was he when The Glazers took over Man Utd? Playing for club and keeping his head down is where he was. Didn't resign then either did you Gary?
Why should the players have to suffer when all they will be doing is keeping their heads down and obeying their employers.....just like you did Gary!!!! I'm a Man Utd fan of over 30 years and I feel nauseous at Gary Neville's views. I'd much more respect the views of people who don't work for SKY who have a much more open and unbiased agenda. Call me cynical if ye like but I've yet to ever see Gary Neville take a real stand on anything except just mumble and groan like many others."

stevensarson482,2021-04-18T23:34:54Z,0,"If you look at the American style franchise model , as applied to other sports, it isn’t too far fetched to envisage teams being relocated and distanced from their roots. I can also imagine players being seeded allowing clubs to accumulate teams and appear in this league, out of nowhere. 
Living in Portugal I can see a different reality than back home in Manchester. Few fans actually attending matches , unless it is between  the top two or three clubs and the chairman being bigger than the manager in every sense. Not good news for someone whose been a fan of United since 1963 and removers the picket fences, the cricket style scoreboard and queuing all night with a book full of tokens, ahead of a cup final."

jorism,2021-04-18T23:34:39Z,0,"Agree with Gary, however modern football is a joke anyway. 95% of the teams in UCL and Europa League are always the same. If you really want to stop all this they need to limit the money. Teams should have a maximum transfer budget (for example 100m) and a maximum wages budget of 100m a year. Only this way you stop all this bullshit, they will be more creative and youth will get a better chance. This will also make sure leagues, UCL and Europa League aren't always the same."

Kinggweeny,2021-04-18T23:33:00Z,0,"Put that many limitations on the breakaways teams that players think twice about playing for them. No playing for country, no playing for teams outside the Super League. Players have a short time as a top top player so stop them from playing anywhere else outside the Super League if they decide to leave/deemed not good enough anymore. Make the Super League so elite that players, not teams are restricted. Players will then think twice. If Sky TV, Virgin etc shun the league how will thy get their monies. They will be forced to come back, just be strong from the start for the good of the sport."

It's extremely insulting to the fans I for one will be against the owners for this, not for the 1st time they've tried something for greed.
So out of touch.
Complete disgrace & embarrassed to ve a fan, which i never thought I'd say.

StartRecording,2021-04-18T23:26:41Z,0,"A ""European Super League"" sounds like the kind of thing you make in FIFA and after a few games you get bored of it and stop, what's the point of a league where no one gets promoted to something and relegated to something? the Champions League is all we need in terms of something similar to a ""Super League"" because its essentially a Super Tournament! Also this means there' will be EVEN MORE games and travelling which will make all the players even more tired because of this completely unnecessary and awful idea."

Hilariumosis,2021-04-18T23:06:27Z,0,"It's purely a money decision from the supporting clubs, only already big and rich clubs will be part of it which will boost their development and separate themselves even more from the lesser competitive teams although these teams won't be in the Champions League so less competition there. Also all players in this new league won't be allowed to play in the Euros, World Cup or the Olympics. Sucks for their national teams. Football is for everyone and both UEFA and FIFA is suppose to be fair for everyone to compete, if you've fought your way through you deserve your place. Crazy that clubs can just go and create their own thing like this for their own benefit. It goes against the spirit of football! I could no longer support my team had it been part of such bullshit. I have better values!

I don't promote separation!"

The game has been stupidly diluted with money and the integrity ripped out of it for decades now, this is just a natural progression of wheels that were set in motion a long time ago.

It's a bit late to be all up in arms about it now, this Super League was brought up donkeys ago.

Football got past the point of no return once footballers wages got over about £5k per week.  I didn't hear anyone complaining back then.  Now you're looking at silliness like £350k plus per week.

The whole industry is drunk on all the money, these pundits included and I'm willing to bet nobody would be prepared to take a pay cut if they were asked to in consideration of the fans."

TheFergo911,2021-04-18T22:39:18Z,0,This definitely is a move to get leverage over UEFA. The moves being made by UEFA over the structure of the Championship League is why all of those clubs came together and had their names down in a statement. If anyone is wondering why PSG wasn't among these clubs it may be because the owner of PSG is also among the members of UEFA and also other economic ties. Bayern must not have joined as there is public ownership and that makes it complicated to make such a decision.

All that does is harm the fans of these clubs. The ONLY way this is solved is for there to be a redistribution of power away from these greedy owners and back to the fans. Same as in everyday life then, so it probably won't happen and we will constantly have to struggle along with these criminals owning our clubs for profit. Sad times"

Do not watch the games to give them ratings, do not buy the jerseys and merchandise, don't buy tickets and go to their games, just completely boycott anything and anyone associated with this league. They'd be investing so much into its creation that the lack of an immediate return would convince investors to pull out, and the idea would die quickly. You reap what you sow."

jdrummerdd,2021-04-18T22:14:37Z,0,"I think us Americans have a pretty unique view of this because all US sports are closed shops. The top is the top, so there will never be a Leicester or Atalanta in american sports leagues, plus you have to VOTED in to ownership when trying to buy a team, it is the ultimate billionaires club. Either you become a top level player or you find a different career, there is no chance of a small town team being seen on a national level, there are no semi pro american sports that can support a living.What these clubs are doing is following American ownership styles, they are trying to be the NFL essentially, the problem with soccer is that its a global sport with its own history. In america, its less than 100 years for most of our major sports, which means the history is written by the people who own the teams, and we don't know what a league is like that is different than what we have. I mean just look at MLS, it resembles a NFL style league more than world football. You can be a team like my Colorado rockies and be awful for our entire history and nobody is punished besides the fans, because the owners know as long as they are making money the league won't want them out or to move locations. It is literally saying that our ""sports are a business first"" because we have such little sense of loyalty lol. Praying this proposal falls apart because the last thing I want is more sports thinking America is the best model of sports."

If they do a super league stealing the top teams it will open the champions league up to more teams being able to play and win it that never really stood a chance against the giants of football.
I dont like that the new competition is a closed league tho. 
Maybe make 1 team relegated a year and the winners of the champions league get promoted. Something like that. But
In my opinion there is nothing wrong with having a separate competition that challenges the champions league. 
Nothing wrong with healthy competition in a free market. 
Whats happening now is every association is ganging up on the teams that signed up. Threatening to punish players clubs fans and owners aswell as banning them from competitions and even threatening individual players from entering the competition after they leave that club. You want to know what a cabal is. Thats the very definition. 
Who gave the champions league and uefa the power to dictate what club and player  have to compete in which league/ competition 
Of course the champions league and uefa oppose the proposal. They lose money and it knocks them off of there perch. 
I think people are being way over the top with this. You want a real issue with football right now. Sort out this ridiculous VAR

I can understand their protectionist point of view, but they have bled the average football fan for every single penny in their pockets. Its time the game was put back on terrestrial TV, and if we have a chance of that through a super league, then I am all for it.

The cup winners cup for cup winners. Then they changed it all when half the league qualifies for europe. Same in the world cup and Euros.

And this nonsense will kill the golden goose."

Kopgenie,2021-04-18T21:50:43Z,0,"Disagreement here, Neville's solution is completely wrong and unfair. It's not the players or the managers that choose this stuff, they're just doing what they're paid to do, they don't get a say in this but to relegate them and deduct points is really unfair to them. He talks about loyalty and tradition where's the sympathy for the players caught in the middle just trying to do their job?"
spankysmp,2021-04-18T21:50:34Z,0,Completely agree but the irony hasn't escaped me where Sky / Sky Sports contributed to the start of the end for football re: Premier League and the ridiculous prices paid for Premier League packages...but Gary won't mention that...
dx-1742,2021-04-18T21:50:25Z,6,I think it's rich coming from a broadcaster who charges customers extortionate amounts of money to show a game of football. What clearly is happening here is that Sky and the Premier League are no longer the biggest fish in the pond and of course they start complaining about how money has ruined football when they're now the underdog. Do not forget Sky has played a part in creating this exploitative culture.

The reality is that the PL will be ruined. All it took is for 1 of Englands 'big 6' to stand up and say no but none of them had the bottle to. The fans done want it. End of.

peterdowney1492,2021-04-18T21:48:23Z,0,Micah's shocked at the City owners because of all the money they have spent in the area around Beswick/Bradford in Manchester? Sheikh Mansour is a member of the Royal Family of Dubai and a prominent politician - deputy prime minister. It doesn't take much searching to find how badly immigrant workers are treated in that country. It's great for the people of that area of Manchester. But it's not done out of the goodness of their hearts.
crazyq4706,2021-04-18T21:48:23Z,0,"As an outsider looking in from America, I love promotion/relegation.  It is such a obscure concept in the U.S. but you need to hold teams accountable and that's something that doesn't happen here. You don't want to go down the road of throwing seasons on purpose, just to pocket the revenue in provide nothing back to the fans or teams. Baseball is notorious for this business model and it strips away any type of passion towards the game."

I've never been to anfield because i have lived in a different country all my Life and have rarely had the occasion to watch any games so i was mostly limited to just following it on Onefootball or google and now that everything is coming back to normal we are planning to go to England so we can finally go to anfield and watch the players in the flesh, but ti come and see them playing in this ""European Superleague"" just playing atletico and Juve every week is just heartbreaking to say the least"

This Super League will destroy football as we know it forever. All it is about money, all these club executives don't care about the fans who pay hundreds of pounds every year to follow their club both home and away while also buying merchandise and kits which already cost a fortune. This is a disgrace and will rip the soul completely out of football, the Super League must be resisted by all sporting and legal means it is nothing but a power grab. Football was a sport created by working class people but it is being stolen by a few rich elite who have no loyalty to the clubs and the history that they represent. All players should stand up and refuse to play in this super league and fans should refuse to watch any games. Enough is Enough, as a United fan I am ashamed of the club abandoning its history, tradition and loyalty to all the fans who have followed during the good and bad times and this is how they are going to be repaid."

We want the cold nights at Stoke, giant killers in domestic cups, the come backs, Derby dramas. It all gets taken away with this super league. Relegate all 6 teams and we call it even. Relegate them after matchday 37, and let them feel the embarrassment on matchday 38. They will never forget that feeling and appreciate what they had."

This is a test of character and I agree with Gary, deduct all the points those clubs have accumulated this season and let them fight relegation for the rest of the season. This is not my game anymore. I’m 51 and went to see my team Newcastle for the first time in 1976. I’ve made friends for life because of football, freezing my bollocks off in the Gallowgate end and getting splashed with wee from the bloke behind while I watched Alan Shoulder, John Brownlie and Mick Martin. These guys weren’t on much more than my Dad. Now, I’ve got nowt in common with the modern day footballer.

I think, all these teams should get punished, but this must be done wisely. Get them relegated would be just a bigger impetus for them to break away. Even though I'd rather watch Chelsea play Crewe Alexander in League Two, than watch a single match of the Super League.

As for a fan of a club – my club is above all clubs for me, but it is not above the spirit of the game. The Super League would kill the spirit. We have to stop this."

Puts clubs with money into a league where they only make more money even if they fail to do well domestically. It's a disgrace and shameful that the owners of the club I support decided to accept such proposals, it will destroy competitive football big time! 

As for relegating only Liverpool, Man Utd, Arsenal only because of their history and traditions, I don't agree with that. If you want to punish teams that accepted such proposals then you should hold all clubs equally accountable. End of the day, you only end up hurting a few greedy owners and give another few a pass and in the future incentivise big money owners to take over clubs with little history so those people get a pass."

The top teams in the premier league are already greedy because they can sign the best world class players. As a Southampton supporter for many years, my club can't compete against the top teams in the premier league because of the gulf in finances. You can predict virtually every season now that it is Man C, Man U, Liverpool, Chelsea who dominate the top of the premier league. Maybe it is a good idea for them to go and play in a European Super League however, it won't be fun for their supporters as they will be playing against similar quality teams and will not be able to dominate the league. One to debate maybe?"

This is an international disgrace and an attempt to milk every last penny. These club owners don’t represent our football clubs. They don’t represent the memories or the passion we have for the game.

Other than that I think it makes sense to evolve the state of European football and to shake it up a bit. 
And let’s be clear, if the premier league kicks those 6 clubs out of the prem for good, the league will go down the shitter. The money will dry up, the sponsorships will disappear. And the football will get worse and worse.

Would it even make financial sense for a club like Everton to invest heavily anymore in the building of a new stadium for instance? They wouldn’t get half the revenue they get now. 
The worldwide appeal to watch the premier league would dwindle massively. And that is a harsh but very real situation the premier league find themselves in unfortunately. These clubs hold the cards imo"

anthonyumoh8488,2021-04-18T21:12:30Z,0,"I hate the idea just as much as everyone else does. However for some of these owners if they have a chance make money they will do anything. In the sixties, Santos wouldn't compete in the Copa Liberdatores, as they wanted to make money of Pele and would go and play teams around the world. Could you imagine, Barcelona not competing in the champions league just because they want to make money of messi and would then play a friendly in China, for example. This is an American model,  and who knows how far they can take this. Maybe they will at a draft or whatever. When I do watch NBA games you realise the lack of culture the fans have. We have to all unite and stop this disgusting idea."

sumroy75,2021-04-18T21:05:00Z,0,"The bottom line is that the American owners of Man U, Liverpool and Arsenal are mostly to blame.  They want to turn European football into an American sports league.  No relegation is key to that to secure their investment.

Then guess what? There will be a sporting void in England, in particular.  These owners all have stakes in American teams and they are itching to expand to Europe.   Baseball has started playing games in London, the NFL has a deal to play at Spurs stadium and there’s more coming.  Sports will be irreparably damaged for older viewers and a boon to younger viewers.  And the younger consumer always wins."

This has been years in the making & set in motion by the highly money incentivised format that the premier league is. Too much money in the game, most of it going to the clubs who classify themselves as “elite” and have been encouraged to do so by the broadcasters. Letting them leave might just make football pure and honest again."

All hypocrisy. It's going to be the biggest sports competition in the world and you all are going to watch it, G. Neville included. It is inevitable. As much as unequal football might be, big teams currently subsidize a lot the small teams. Nothing wrong with that but when the money are not right (like now during the pandemics) big teams have this power.
All that said, there's nothing wrong having a true big European competition. Football at its very best. Other sports have it, why not football too ?"

Relegate them take their money wth is he thinking? These clubs make their own money even city I think 😂. And it's not right for anyone to take their tv money as they are the biggest clubs so they deserve either more money than the rest or at least equal money as the rest of the clubs. I am not in favour of this super league concept but don't for one second kid yourselves that most of the people are interested in watching Everton or Leicester win the league. They are not! These big clubs are the reason why the premier league earns so much money! And how sky and pundits like him earn money now. So please stop behaving like a child and stop throwing tantrums!! But hopefully they reach a solution for all the clubs involved 🙏

Juventus Vs Chelsea
PSG Vs Liverpool

They want that week in, week out, all season round, for the drama and the occation of it all.

It's completely wrong and will kill the game, but when India buy 100 million Manchester United Shirts, or Japan buy millions Liverpool shirts..you lose something.

These are the fans who will support Arsenal one week, then Chelsea the next week if they lose.

They have no concept of the heart of Europeam football. The fans and the ability to climb to the top."

Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal are PROPER FOOTBALL CLUBS. They’re run properly, they have a global fan base and history.

I'm a City fan and personally can't understand why City would want this for pretty much the reasons Micah said as well as the fact these other clubs involved  have spent the last 8 years or so trying to get City out of the Champions League so why would they get involved with them in this when these very clubs owners will be running the show? If City do this there will be no point in season tickets etc. as they won't be worth it. IMO

stephenhodgson3506,2021-04-18T20:43:59Z,1,"The English game survived when Man City were playing in the third tier, it survived when Man U were in the second tier, it survived when Spurs got relegated, it survived when Arsenal were a mid table side for years. It survived when Chelsea won an occasional cup and it survived when Liverpool failed to win a title for thirty years. There are other clubs in England with large supporter bases that will take their places. Let them go but let them know that when their fancy league collapses they will have to start again at the bottom of the pyramid. 

I know this is on Sky but the football authorities need to let the TV and media companies know that if they sign up to this then they will not be allowed to bid for any other football contracts world wide. That they will not be allowed to show any live games or highlights except for the 'Super' league they have signed on to. That means the World Cup as well and all other International competitions. Let's see just how many subscribers they get when all they have to offer are constant repeats of the same games. Let's see how much advertising revenue they can get when the advertisers know that it won't be long until the ratings crash.

I'm convinced that this is been driven by the Americans who want a franchise system just like they have in the own sports back in the US. They are all terrified that what happened to Blackburn could happen to their investment and they want to ring fence it."

mikedc,2021-04-18T20:32:03Z,0,"Lol the part he said ""Joke"" made me laugh. But he right. It's about the money. But is it the clubs to blame or the players who demand high salary per week wages? The clubs big or small need the money for wages. So big money is needed for clubs super or not just to attract and or keep the big names at clubs. Clubs need money. Greed or not. The clubs are greedy and so are the players. Let's not blame the clubs. I'm sure the players have a say or not complaining. More games more paychecks or increase in wages per week. Let's really think about how good this might be over time."

Also if the big six break away then come back after the Super League’s inevitable failure they should have to start at the bottom of at least the Football League if not in non league. Disloyalty like that should be punished."

Andrew-gw8df,2021-04-18T20:30:53Z,1,"1. You cannot argue that it is financially unfair to smaller clubs for the bigger clubs to leave while admitting the bigger clubs generate all the revenue that supports the smaller clubs. Big clubs earn the revenue because their investors provided the capital to purchase players that fans pay to see, but their revenue is split to smaller clubs who do not contribute. It would be much more financially fair if bigger clubs played each other and split the revenue between them.
2. I understand the hesitation from fans who want to see the current system remain, so do I actually, but I think fans should keep an open mind to the reasoning behind such a proposal: If these American investors think they will make more money, that means the Super League is projected to earn way more money that the current system. How is that possible if the entertainment factor is worse? If their financial projections are correct, people will pay more money to watch matches between big clubs. This makes total sense given the difference in viewership in Champions League elimination rounds vs group stage matches.

The fact is, fans who are whining talk up the important of ""fair competition"" when a proposal like this is made, but in actuality, these fans do not watch matches between big clubs and small clubs. If you really cared about the existence of the current system, why don't you watch Sheffield vs Brighton? The reason why you don't watch these matches (ie. patronize these matches) is the same reason why they are proposing a Super League."
SCD-BOY,2021-04-18T20:30:47Z,0,"Fans haven't been allowed to there grounds to watch there clubs in over a year, travel restrictions apply for how long we don't know & all they want to think about is how many more billion can we make."

It will be a absoulutely huge loss. And it will also affect the game in a terrible way. Football will evolve to this money hungry and greedy game. Where all the clubs care about is money. Enough is enough i cant deal with any of this bs that has been implemented in Football like VAR🤦🏽‍♂️😤"

So when Man United plays lets say Barca in this super league, no police would be provided for security, let them pay for their own security staff in and outside of the stadium. I know they already pay for security but there is still police there.  The tickets for these matches would be taxed at higher rate, the stuff they are selling also tax at higher rate. Players in these teams cannot play in any international competition. Players making money playing for these clubs and all employees there also taxed at higher rates.

Trophies? Championships?  They ONLY care about those as long as they increase the value of the other things I mentioned.  Don't get me wrong, I still watch football.  I grew up a Man-U fan, but I stopped looking at these organizations with reverence and with admiration YEARS ago.  And with more and more money coming from Asia and the middle east, these problems will only get worse. Case-in-point, Man City.  Get your collective heads out of your collective arses!  You want your DOMESTIC leagues to flourish and maintain the charactiristics you admire about a football organization.....eliminate foreign investment or have it capped to non-controlling % like 25%.  That will result if wages not keeping up with some other leagues around the world, but at least it will be YOUR league."

Gary has to represent the real view of every real fan in the world. It’s time to get rid of this money grabbing rich list and let them go to their own demise. They don’t have real fans just followers that go for glory. Dump the clubs that just keep ripping off their followers and as they have broken their contract with the premier league just remove their association with the FA which will remove every player from availability for selection for their country. The players will either choose to play for club or pride. I hope they all chooses pride

archiekirkup2750,2021-04-18T20:20:03Z,0,We would loose all the quality players in the league and if they broke away away what player wants to be on a flight every week they’ll hardly be able to settle as well as there only being one game a week. It’s ridiculous. This would hurt the lower leagues as well if they did break away because they wouldn’t be buying players from the championship and leagues 1 and 2 if they are trying to have young players with good potential they’ll all go to Germany like sancho and belingham.

No league is actually fair financially because top teams have big money to spend always so how is it a fair system? cases of Leicester winning the league is luck."

The whole point of watching a game is competition, I want to watch 11 lads from liverpool play 11 lads from Manchester and see who come out on top, even that is diminished now, but a wider context is to watch clubs of lads from all over england and all over Europe compete.  If you just reduce it to 12 brands competing with paid mercenaries it no longer becomes an inter-city competition.

monkeybone39,2021-04-18T20:16:41Z,0,Fact is this started way back when the Prem Lg started. Its a bit rich to call this greed when the system we have is built on nothing but greed and profit margins- clubs are on the stock market. I didnt hear Gary shouting about dominance  when United were flying. Im undecided but we ALL know the FA is not fit for purpose and UEFA have continually been linked with corruption; some proven. To point the finger at LFC? Come on Gary - go expletive yourself. Greed greed greed? - greed that started with the onset of the Premier League remember. As for slating the owners? You easily forget that it took these owners to bail these clubs out; both LFC and United were nearly in administration. Methinks there's a few jobs on the line and some are looking after their own greed.

Absolute disgrace. Instead of leading by example, they do this. Im disappointed in Chelseas and Liverpools board the most bc out of the 6 they are the most decent. Glazers, Kroenke, Levy, Mansour all money grabbers and greeders. Abramovich at least helped during the covid pandemic his staff and the nhs workers, and Liverpool were never thought as some money splashing tycoons.

How is it fair for the likes of Leicester, West-Ham, Everton and most other clubs, trying to compete with the money bags that has ruined the game. I'm not for this super league but at least if the top teams are gone, that will mean other clubs can actually start winning some trophies. The problem with football is the money and until that is controlled nothing will change. Man City, Man Utd and Chelsea have ruined this league. The other top teams, Arsenal, Spurs and Liverpool can't even compete with them 3. Just look over the years of the teams constantly wining all the trophies. It took Liverpool 30 years to win the Premiership and that's because like other teams they can't compete financially. They had to sell top players to raise the cash. Spurs are the same but unfortunately have not won anything and Arsenal have turned into a middle table club now. These billionaires are destroying the game we love because all it is to them is a play thing. There is no fairness in football, it's like life, the rich get everything they want, while the rest have to scrape from the barrel."

Regarding the threat to players, that they won´t be able to play in their national teams: good luck with that UEFA! Who will watch games between the B or C players of each country, when you can watch the best of the best elsewhere, every week? Also, the best players of each country can also organize themselves privately, to play against other private national teams made of the best, thus bypassing the vultures in Nyon.

if these people really cared about what was once a great sport theyd hav been talking about this every wk, all the time. 
but its been silent. these same pundits talking all the ""man city winning the league by record points was a great achievement. Guardiola is a genius"" etc. its all nonsense. bought and paid for points, trophies, leagues."

The greed of these owners is destroying the greatest game on the planet, and I’m so ashamed that my club is a part of it. It feels like loosing a lifelong friend, but ultimately it is now clear that domestic, loyal fans mean nothing to these foreign owners who have sucked the soul out of great footballing institutions."

The expansion of the CL to include non-champions was introduced by UEFA to head off talk of a breakaway super league. They're the ones that have given these clubs the power to get away with crap like this.

If Real and Barca aren’t in the Champions League or La Liga, the SFA and UEFA loose millions. Everyone is out to make money, they are all as bad as each other. Let’s not pretend that the federations wanting them to stay is out of integrity. Even Sky would be paying the clubs if they started this Super League and making a song and dance about it on their channel whilst charging us huge amounts to watch it. Also their will still be home games? And away days will be in Europe not Southampton. Let’s be honest if you ask any football fan who would rather watch you team vs Burnley away or Real Madrid away, we know what the answer is. Also the CL is fixed. It’s hugely in favour of the same 5/6 teams to win every year. So where’s the challenge? I don’t think this should happen for the knock on effect in English football. But let not kid ourselves that any argument for or against isn’t about money."

jmwaniki,2021-04-18T20:07:41Z,0,"Hypocrisy here! Football has become big business. And like it or not, the big six are considered the big 6. when they go in to get talent at any club in the world, they are given ‘big 6’ prices. They also have to pay higher salaries for their players. But somehow, unlike Spain where the big boys get a bigger cut of the proceeds, in the EPL, it’s a fair split. So these clubs, who generate by far the largest interest and hence money for the league , are meant to continue to do a service for football. No! Football is a global game. If the fans in the UK won’t watch the game, billions around the world will. The money in the league is because the clubs can auction the rights to the league to billions across the planet. Perhaps with the right investments, this clubs can secure themselves. I know if I was a footballer I’d jump at the chance to play in a season long league competition against the best players on the planet. Not hope about getting drawn against some players in the champions league! Sign and get into the super league!!"

Blockchain will *eliminate* or seriously make irrelevant people like *Mina Raiola.* Blockchain will empower fans by enabling them to have *fractional ownership* of the club. *Like what Tesla and Apple is doing with their stocks in conjunction with Binance.*

*You as a club owner* is the perfect candidate to be a pioneer of the use of blockchain in club ownership and players contract ownership.

jmmypaddy,2021-04-18T20:03:04Z,0,"Football fans need to stand together (metaphorically during the pandemic and physically afterward) to make a statement and say this is our game. When football fans are able to enter grounds again safely, lets not go to grounds of clubs with bad owners. Go to your local non-league team, they sure as hell need your money more."

mattstevenson5849,2021-04-18T20:02:10Z,0,"Gary made a comment about the timing being atrocious due to the pandemic and the global economic situation.

These factors are the reason why this concept has gathered pace.  Modern football, especially the top clubs in Europe, have had an unsustainable financial model for two decades.  Look at Barcelona, biggest club in the world, on the verge of bankruptcy, and they need this super league to happen to sustain their decadence.

Football now is all about share prices, and competition is irrelevant."

In SA towards the late 80's, Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates, Moroka Swallows, broke away from the then PSL to form the NPSL because football administrators become too powerful to the detriment of the clubs. Guess what, almost all the clubs followed, sponsors switched allegiance and fans remained with their clubs. The rest is history!!!"

tshiremonchonyane1365,2021-04-18T20:01:30Z,1,"Not surprised because People who own these clubs are business men/women. IT’s cutthroat. Some of them don’t know a thing about football or could not care less. It’s simply an investment and if an opportunity arises to potentially triple your investment. So be it.
But in the long run this superLeague thing is a TERRIBLE IDEA financially. THERE IS ONLY AS MUCH MONEY AS THERE IS IN FOOTBALL BECAUSE OF THE MARKET. THE FANS! They are ones that pay subscriptions, go to games ect.  
Personally : Barca V United every other weekend don’t sound that enticing to me.  PArt of the attraction for these big matches is that they don’t happen often"

If they can spare £20billion on track and trace they can surely spend £20billion saving English football. Well said Gary!

Soccer/football is the English dna, it’s a religion. Yes there’s money involved but it’s about the community, it’s a weekend ritual that almost everyone follows. That’s what I admired so much being over the pond. I love American sports it definitely has its place it works, but that’s because the country is different, there’s 4 major sports people don’t have the same ties to their clubs. English soccer needs to be defended and returned to its initial purpose, to play for the people."

Remember, team love helped to bring the country together after ww2, helped to give spirit, hope and ambition to a country that was in shambles amid despair and uncertainty.

They already have a European league, the Champions League. That's enough."

Ya whinging coz the money grabbing professionals are getting out grabbed...... absolute joke..... footballers should try and play for minimum wage, and then you've got grounds to whinge about greed...... most fans would play for their teams for free, just for the pride........drive ya £300,000 sports car to your 7 bedroom mansion, and shut up..... whilst the real football fans, who fork out hundreds a season in over priced tickets and cheaply made replica kits, to show their support to their childhood club, get fleeced by fat cat tycoons who use the team as a way to get even richer.......greed..... pfffft..... try working 40 hours a week plus to pay your f*****g rent on time......"

If you have 16 richest clubs playing each other every year without the possibility of relegation it will eventually become meaningless. It is a way to save Real, Barca and Juventus whose greed already destroyed their own leagues. The UK Government and parliament can stop it quite easily, if they want to."
24alexash,2021-04-18T19:48:58Z,0,100% agree with what Neville has to say and I’m assuming so do 99.9% of football fans.

I tried googling it, and all I got was literally companies that sold bottles.

But yeah, as an American who's been following European club football since I lived in Latin America in the late '90's, this would pretty much kill all interest in the game at the club level. Except for watching top U.S. internationals. But even then, I wouldn't ever really care who wins the actual match, so I'd probably just watch highlights, and only watch a full game when it's an international."

All that history will stand for nothing and other great English sides such as Villa, Everton, Leeds etc will be left behind.

The fact is, if pundits like Neville and Sky were as passionate about sportswashing projects like the World Cup, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Man City, PSG, Chelsea etc etc then big clubs wouldn't be pushing for this."

For me, disowning your club is a possibility."
benjamindavies485,2021-04-18T19:38:39Z,0,"I completely agree with Gary Neville. As he said, it all lines the pockets of the club owners who are all foreign. Take the Glazers. They own who the Florida Pirates or some such from the NFL and that team is losing money hand over fist not bringing them in the money so this Super League will just hurt us fans. I’m disgusted"

MrKillaRabbit,2021-04-18T19:38:06Z,15,Well said Gary. I've been a Liverpool fan since as far back as I can remember and this is the first time I've ever been ashamed of the club.
davidburke2132,2021-04-18T19:38:04Z,0,"The way to ensure this stops before it even gets started? FIFA, UEFA and the FA need to maintain their stance that any players who play in this unsanctioned competition would get immediate multi-season bans from all other competitions, including domestic (even if they moved to a different, non-Super League, club) and especially FIFA and UEFA competitions... basically make it so they’ll never play another game outside of the Super League for club or country. 

That way even if it goes ahead those Super League clubs will be so gutted of their talent that it’d be a worse standard of football than the MLS and the product would be dead. 

Without top players being prepared to play for those clubs there is zero chance of this proposal going ahead. Fans can and should unite in condemnation of this, but unfortunately fan power isn’t what it once was. Player power is as big as ever and we need to ensure it’s leveraged for the right outcome here."
mingmerci6103,2021-04-18T19:37:56Z,0,"Got to say again, as a liverpool fan i'm loving Gary more and more, he gets it spot on most of the time, just look at his eyes when talking you can see the hurt. I have always said its easy to sort out football with taking points off clubs, its been about money for way to long. I remember going to anfield in the mid 90's for under £5, im not sure how the can justify the prices they charge now. This scouser loves you man and im sure many others do too."

leebarber1200,2021-04-18T19:37:49Z,0,This won’t be the last attempt at a break away. Gary is bang on with his approach and if the EFA and Premier League do not put a stop to it and punish those who have tried to take the game away from the fans then I think Gary should take the top job in the EFA. Things will change then that’s for sure. Well done Gaz 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

risingstar7161,2021-04-18T19:37:30Z,0,Don't follow football but what GN says rings true. Trouble is the tendency is always toward larger more wealthy clubs who will seek even more wealth which leads to super leagues etc. This is what happens when corporate money enters a sector such as sport and football in particular. Socialise the whole thing give it to the people who pay for the tickets

The remaining Premiership clubs will actually have a title to fight for each year not based on wealth. New league champions on a regular basis. Premiership football died years ago with the excess money for players fees and wages. Football allowed itself to become elitist at the highest level."
PeterEhik,2021-04-18T19:37:17Z,0,"This is our economic system sipping more and more into football, for the last 30 years, power and money have been congregating more and more to a few football clubs. It's not enough that these so called ""big clubs"" make more money now than ever before, they gotta have even more. They're looking at it in terms of how much money they're leaving on the table by having to ""share"" their winnings with the rest of the smaller clubs in their leagues. They don't see any value in expanding football so more and more people can be employed within the sport. They don't see the value in football clubs bringing people together within a geographical area and forming communities. They don't even see the value in fair competition where participants are on somewhat level footing and being the most hardworking and talented team is what it'd take to win. The only thing they believe in is making more money this year than they did last year and leaving nothing on the table. I think it's inevitable that the European Super League happens within the next 5 years, shame."

All the history and success that these clubs have built over the last 100+ years is getting destroyed by the greed and arrogance of these owners. The owners of these clubs haven’t put an ounce of thought into the effect this may have on the fans and on other clubs. These fans have supported their clubs through thick and thin for their whole lives, only for it to get destroyed by a group of people who don’t care at all about the game and what it means to people. Football is for the fans, not for the rich. Gary is absolutely right and coming from a city fan I am ashamed that my club is wanting to join this league."

I understand the pay into the ESL is meant to be much more than the current UCL but why would they think that would last?  This seems like an absurdly short sighted money grab.  What is going to happen in a year or two when the money dries up because people wont watch or they aren't playing in as many competition because of bans etc?  I'm disappointed to see my club signed onto this and I really hope they reconsider.

Most of us across the UK probably support teams in League 2,1 and the championship and without covid would probably go to watch our local team play. Working class people who work to pay tickets to watch their football team every weekend (again without covid) this is a disgrace this concept. Most players even at the big clubs Utd, City etc have gone through their academy system and were privileged to get to the first team - McTominnay, Rashford, Foden etc. Not saying the players were behind this movement but it shows that even with the big clubs money they still rely on academy progression and graduates. Money isn’t everything in football and that’s proven from shock results - Leicester winning the league, A league 2 team knocking a PL giant out in the 3rd round of the FA Cup that’s what we fans regardless if you support Crawley Town or Liverpool love to see. Passion, desire for your club not commercial money inflicting what team you should support!"

markfletcher7901,2021-04-18T19:20:54Z,0,"Premier League success is based entirely on money as it stands so anyone who believes that domestic football in England is a meritocracy at present is deluded. 

A European Super League with all the best teams and talent would surely provide ""heavyweight"" clashes every week. It would also have the added bonus that domestic leagues would become much more competitive and any number of teams could win the ""first division"". 

This is of course entirely different today's reality where 3 teams try to win the league, 4 or 5 others compete for the ""holy grail"" of 4th place (ironically to get a seat at the table with Europe's big boys) and the other 12 or so happy to get to 40 points and get back on the horse next year."

Over paid footballers (should be paid maximum £100,000 year no matter how skilful and reduce admission prices) and banned when faking a dive like a Hollywood stunt person."

But Sky coming out calling it greed is shocking. The same company that wanted people to pay ppv for premier league matches during a pandemic.
Don't act like Sky, The Premier League and UEFA are the good guys in this. They are using us as pawns saying how unfair it is on us while all they 
really care about is the fact that this new league takes money out of their own pockets.
The premier league 29 years ago was born the same way out of greed this time is 10000x worse"

Neville bruh, I respect your opinion but you don't own the clubs so these owners are going to do what's best for their business. I hate to say it. I only watch certain games in the Prem, could you imagine watching la Liga or the Prem without the big boys. End of the day I believe the big boys are flexing because they are the pull in their respective leagues and feel they should command more of the TV money, this is why this super league is being proposed."
TorresinhoLFC,2021-04-18T19:19:40Z,0,I'm not for or against this super league but what do you all expect? The game evolves. I'm my opinion Liverpool/Real/Barca etc these teams don't belong in the same competition as Ludogorets or whatever. Yes the smaller team need to have a chance to play with the big boys but this current champions league format is not for me at least.

ericheadley,2021-04-18T19:19:29Z,0,"Arsenal fan here.  Gary Neville has spoken the absolute truth.  But this is driven by owners who fundamentally care nothing about football and its fans.  It is just a business to them.  Arsenal, Man U and Liverpool DO know better, the owners just don't care.  He's also correct about another thing, the punishment for this has to be severe, otherwise it will just keep reappearing.  Some sort of regulatory framework has to be applied because it is clear these owners do not care about football."

LeighRichards27,2021-04-18T19:18:42Z,0,"There are some very good reasons why this breakaway should be supported - uefa repeatedly failing to act against racism by fans and players, its ludicrous dross from footballing non entities like luxembourg and the faroes can have a club in the champions league while top sides in countries like england, italy and spain miss out, and finally uefa is rotten to the core and is incapable of reforming itself"
tazcinephilia,2021-04-18T19:18:40Z,0,"This pernicious kind of capitalism doesn’t value anything other than profit. These owners don’t care about fan loyalty, belonging, heritage or history – all the things that make a club truly ‘valuable’. These greedy owners want to monetise these values and run off into their gated community of elites. Games played in artificial media bubbles based on plastic Instagram values. Everything good about football destroyed by JP Morgan’s £6billion. Club owners who have backed this should be tarred and feathered, and then kept far away from our beautiful game."
SLM3573,2021-04-18T19:18:36Z,0,the whole thing is just part of the whole Americanisation thats been steadily taking over for last 10 years now.

jeffreymoss,2021-04-18T19:18:22Z,0,"Sports is a business, this is true.  But it also sits in an unusual nexus of business, entertainment, and community.  This is what makes people more passionate and invested in clubs vs. say how they feel toward Virgin, Sony, or Amazon.  If you take any of these three elements away, with a focus here on community, then something significant is lost.  And as an American, where the sense of community is not as old or as entrenched in sports here as it is with soccer in England, I can see quite well how important and special that is.  That's a big reason why I follow Arsenal as passionately as I do.  It's not just to follow a winning club.  It's the sense of belonging to a community, even though I live half a world away.  If Arsenal leaves the EPL, it's leaving its community, its rich history, behind.  It will be a shell of itself.  As with the commentators here, I'm not against change, but have some respect for god's sake.  Because if you devalue the history and sense of community of a club, you render that club just another soulless business entity, and the implications of that will be felt for a long time, including the bottom line."

jarlemalmin,2021-04-18T19:16:01Z,0,A league using the American NBA and basketball system. Also sponsored by an American bank. with a Glazer on the board... someone who do not even know the rules of football. I am sickened by this news and I agree. Relegate all 6 clubs. By the way I am a Man Utd fan and yes I want my own team to be punished here.
OnlyClass100,2021-04-18T19:15:51Z,0,Horrible to be a fan of Chelsea right now! Was feeling so good enjoying the way my team is playing and then this news just shits all over that!

I fully support the idea of punishing them heavily, taking titles, as painful as that may be considering the legacy of Alex Ferguson, and heavy HEAVY fines and deducting points, its about time the ""big"" money in football started being told when enough is enough"
garycampbell1445,2021-04-18T19:15:25Z,0,"I'd let all the teams that want to go, go, but not let them take part in pl or the champions league or the europa league. At the end of the day there is enough big well supported clubs especially in england to fill the void and I think it would make a more competitive league as well and cup competitions would be a lot more interesting. Even the other 2 countries still have decent teams who with competition prize money and more evenly spread tv money could compete more fairly with each other so i would 100percent let all 12 clubs leave in fact I'd let them go tomorrow and take the hit this season just so the teams that might get in the champions league next season have a fair chance to prepare themselves for that"

Some greedy bastards buy a club and all of a sudden these century old institutions are the ones who carry the flak for their decisions. Name the owners who push for this don't let them hide behind club badges when it's their greed pushing these agendas.

I'm totally against the whole thing but Gary himself is wealthy due to a breakaway league designed to create more money for those at the top, this is an evolution of the greed that began in part due to sky. We have nation states owning clubs for christ sake, the idea this is an attack on the integrity of the sport is ludicrous, Sky are huge hypocrites just look at what they have done with PPV in all sports and how they move fixtures to times and dates completely impractical for fans but they don't care. Sky are no different to the money men leeching the game but who are the same people that made the likes of Gary Neville a very rich man. It's a crap idea that was absolutely inevitable once the super rich decided football was just another business to exploit but the hypocrisy on show too is laughable."

Having a super league with no relegation kills it. All fans football fans should organize against this and stop buying season tickets if it goes so far so to being implemented for 1 season. Protect the beautiful game from these greedy capitalists. Respect to Gery for speaking his mind.

Gary Neville is absolutely spot on, he is Utd through and through but to say his own club, amongst others, should be relegated absolutely speaks volumes about how stupid, ludicrous and disgusting that those greedy despicable billionaire owners of these historic clubs are. If this happens there won't be a club to support for those that currently support these greedy clubs but especially for those that support smaller clubs when they have to fold. A sad sad day for football fans and for football in general if this happens. Veey well said Gary 👏👏👏👏"

kshitiznarang3027,2021-04-18T19:10:41Z,0,"Counter point to Gary Neville's comments about the new proposed league- what about the immense power that has been given to the channels like Sky Sports who dictate the amount of games a team should play. 2 years ago when Liverpool were in world club cup competition, it were these channels that decided to host a game in UK a day after Liverpool were to play a game in a different continent altogether. They make billions and share only millions with the clubs.
From business perspective and from the player's perspective, this move makes sense."
RobSyerGaming,2021-04-18T19:10:41Z,0,"It would completely destroy the special feeling of European football, and feel like a waste time. As a Liverpool fan absolutely disgusted. What's the point of being in a super league when there's no end game, no qualification for major competitions and no relegation, playing the same few big clubs every year. 😡"
Marcelo83uk,2021-04-18T19:10:40Z,0,"Agreed with Neville who I can't stand listening to normally... had to slap myself but fair play to him!

davidbriggs143,2021-04-18T19:10:37Z,1,"All fans, no matter who they support, should all join together and say “enough is enough” put rivalries aside for the time being and fight the threat these greedy mercenaries are bringing to our game. Fans rule football and they need a reminder about that. Boycott games and companies who sponsor this super league and boycott the tv channel that will bid for these games. When it hits and hurts their pockets they will listen. Shameful."

me5969,2021-04-18T19:10:10Z,0,Even as a kopite Gary Neville is probably my favourite pundit anyway and he’s spot on here. If Liverpool do this then I’m supporting Rangers or there’s this sport called “Rugbyball” I believe and fat people chase an egg around. I don’t really know what it is but I might start watching that because Liverpool will just not exist as a football club to me anymore. I’d honestly rather we we all got relegated tbh.. although my bird is a manc so we might actually find a football team or sport together where we don’t want to kill each other.
animelytical8354,2021-04-18T19:10:10Z,0,They aren't fans of football. Period. They know nothing about the sport and want to make a European version of the NFL where they have the rights to freely abuse players and fans alike.

invernessfan3017,2021-04-18T19:09:34Z,1,"I think the Scottish teams should set something up. I support a Celtic Cup on top of domestic and European football. We could have all Scottish Premier sides, plus a selection of sides from N Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Wales, and Cornwall. Imagine games like Aberdeen v Wrexham, Linfield v Glashow Rangers and Glasgow Celtic v Shamrock Rovers. I do not thi9nk UEFA would allow a European Super League. But they do allow cross border cups. Look at the way Irish, Welsh and English sides were allowed in the Scottish Challenge Cup."

Why shouldn’t the likes of Benfica, Ajax, Celtic, Anderlecht, Red Star Belgrade & Olympiacos not dream of winning the UCL. It just isn’t right, 2 spots at most is enough for a league, the league winner gets a spot and the domestic cup winner or league runner up gets the 2nd spot, wealth should be distributed around more fairly."

republicstatesentertainmen6124,2021-04-18T19:01:13Z,0,Gary is absolutely right there is no need of the super league they already have the champions league instead to compete with other countries and the premier league will never be the same without the top 6 sides.

In the United States they are no relegation in their leagues, and money stays with the top leagues. It’s embarrassing but it’s the reality of what the business side of sports is.
And I thought this league was created in mind by the big clubs in Europe to rival the Uefa Champions league and not domestic leagues?"

steveaustin1011,2021-04-18T18:59:28Z,0,"These foreign owners (especially the Yank ones), just done have a clue about English football. 

This isn't the first time these knobheads have fucked up like this. 

I'd love to say I'm shocked but I'm not. 

However if you look at it, the clubs haven't actually said they wanna leave the Premier League that's what the Premier league are saying will happen if they choose to join this league rather then play in the CL. 

As all the clubs that wanna leave the CL are wanting to join this new super league for a more steady Income of money and more say on how its ran, which I'm sure we all agree is bollox and tbh unnecessary. 

This is really short sighted too, as the teams really pushing for this from the continent I.E the Juve owner, they want this because their falling well behind the English clubs especially when it comes to revenue. 

When teams like Leicester are making nearly if not more money then you, and you are considered the biggest club in that country, then its plain to see you have issues. 

This would the old cutting the nose off to spite the face and therefore a bad one. 

Let's but it this way none of the fans want it, so it wont happen, but these club owners need to be held to account more often."

David-ej1ps,2021-04-18T18:58:05Z,0,"Anyone arguing against the Super League clearly does not understand the concept of leverage...

-FA, UEFA, EPL, La Liga etc do not take on any risks... they don't build, own or maintain stadiums because the clubs do. They don't scout, develop and pay players the clubs do. 

-They do not lose money and come under pressure from fans when a team is not performing because the clubs do. 

-They keep on adding more useless fixtures (nations league etc) within the calendar year to line up their pockets at the expense of the players and the clubs, who by the way are the ones who have to pay the price when their players are injured.

-These are the same institutions that allow rubbish refereeing and questionable decisions to continue season after season and clubs have to just accept it even though that costs them points and effectively money

Meanwhile the FA, La Liga, Serie A etc take a large chunk of the broadcasting rights for taking absolutely ZERO RISK. they do not build stadiums, they do not have fan bases, they do not scout and develop players yet are getting paid billions....??

The clubs are right for doing this. If you look at that list you will see the following
- all those clubs have the largest followings and bases, PEOPLE WILL WATCH THE SUPER LEAGUE
- none of those leagues are interesting without those CLUBS because they all have the longest histories, championship wins and rivalries between them within their respective leagues
-those clubs all NEED to spend money (buying/developing players/building stadiums) to stay competitive, that's simply how it is 

I am honestly not surprised"

harrymichael18,2021-04-18T18:55:31Z,0,Kroenke is the prime example of what Gary is talking about. He hasn’t been to a game since Arsenal Wenger last game at the emirates. He has put a penny into Arsenal and places debt on us by taking 6 million out. It’s embarrassing
kd84afc,2021-04-18T18:55:23Z,0,"Tottenham?  Don't care about them lol he made me laugh when he said that! But joking aside, As an Arsenal supporter Gary Neville as spoken sense on many issues in football over the last few years and one of the most decent pundits that's in football today.  

What he said in this footage is 100% spot on! If the 6 teams break away and create a superleague I think I will forget about watching football or I'd rather go and support Leyton Orient as this intent is nothing but greed from billionaire owners looking to make the most money as they can! 100% pure greed."

And there would be competition in a new league. 

There doesn’t have to be relegation for there to be competition. 

Plenty of other team sports have leagues without relegation that are still competitive.

Gary Neville is an uneducated bandwagon riding idiot. Banging on about “big clubs”. 

Do shut up."

beaumont6541,2021-04-18T18:55:13Z,3,Fair play to Garry here. Haven't heard this much honesty on a tv in so long. For him to say to deduct points from MU just shows that he sees it's not about clubs it's about football.
86craigm,2021-04-18T18:55:13Z,0,"The premiere league and other governing bodies ruined the game long before super league came about. Players are on ridiculous amounts of money. The fans have been outpriced out of supporting their teams. Ticket prices/tv prices are ridiculous. Sounds to me a bit pot, kettle, black. Hypocrites the lot of them. They go on about being offensive to the fans, they are just protecting themselves. Money thats all its about. They don't care about the fans."

A club is only as available as the support it gets. If these clubs leave and no one supports them their super league will fail and they will have to sell the team.

tolkienfan10,2021-04-18T18:50:15Z,0,"Nev is 100% on the money with that rant, but then he is a fan, first and foremost. His job is not at risk, in fact, he's paid to offer his opinion as a tv pundit. Ole, on the other hand, was predictable in his lukewarm response, as it does involve his job with those above him at board level having made the decision to give this breakaway league the thumbs up.

Ultimately, it's not surprising that the Glazers, Abramovich, the FSG group, the Kroenkes, all foreign investors, are divorced in their values from the real fans. They're in it to make money, the fans are in it for the love of the game. Easier said than done but the sooner the league scraps foreign owners, the better."

   If the Premier League can give them more money, they'll stay. If the Premier League can not, bye bye. It's just good business. You think the players care about the history? None of them are playing for free, by the way.
  Talking about ""history"", yeah, you can keep your history, Cash is actual labor value. Pump 500 millions Euros into one club and they'll be making history, like Manchester City.

ManofReason,2021-04-18T18:43:10Z,0,"What do those clubs intend on using that money for? 

Currently, a club who gets/has a lot of money will be able to use that to improve their team and compete for higher level competitions, but where will they buy those players from? 

If you take Ronaldo when he was a Man United, Henry when he was at Arsenal, Hazard when he was at Chelsea etc. Those clubs had no problem with them leaving to go to the Spanish League, as they do not affect their domestic leagues and more than likely won't play against them in Europe. If all those clubs were in the same league, then  Man United, Arsenal and Chelsea wouldn't want to sell their best players to a direct competitor. 

Also, most top clubs buy the better players from the clubs that are lower in the table - Liverpool have bought from Southampton and Chelsea have bought from Leicester, for example, but clubs like Southampton and Leicester wouldn't want to sell their best players, as they now have a better chance of winning the Premier League - would those players also want to be banned from international games?

What happens to Women's football? Are they banned from Women's Premier League. They are run by the same people, at the end of the day.

Who do the youth teams play against? Most top clubs young players were usually, at some point, at a lower level team - would they take the move?

No way could this work.

May be ok as a little pre-season tournament, but nothing else and with a lot less money involved."

Here is a history for most of you, back in the 1950-70s there were many competitions ran by other organisations outside of FIFA ie the Club World Cups between Brazilian teams and European teams. The hypocrisy from these organisations are hysterical because they have dominated and become greedy, while pointing and saying the same for the clubs. If it weren't for the clubs there wouldn't be the need for these organisations.  I would like to see this idea because the competition would reach new levels of professionalism."

I am not saying I think it's a good idea, but I have not ulterior motives, Gary does.

Obviously, the only reason there is no relegation or promotion is because the PL does not agree to it.  3 years later the PL with come and be willing to work with them

""A criminal act"" is making the fans watch 3/4s of the team park the bus each week... that's not great for the fans... if the top 6 teams were out the PL then the other teams wouldn't be parking the bus, and the top 6 teams would be against other teams who go after it.

I'm not sure how it helps the fans? You can't get tickets to matches, and if you could they are so expensive for someone to take their 2 kids.

So how does the present situation help fans?

the PL - make money
the FA - make money
Sky - make money

So lets be clear... everyone else makes money on this... so stop with the drama

northlondonsmostred-arsena9544,2021-04-18T18:33:21Z,3,I just don’t think anyone wants this! The champions league is fine as it is! Let alone a super league! 🙄
johnderwin2119,2021-04-18T18:33:21Z,0,not a fan of Neville but fair fucks to him didnt hold back
Jamie-kv9eg,2021-04-18T18:33:19Z,0,Absolutely disgraceful if this goes through
Loverofdaimbars,2021-04-18T18:33:08Z,0,It's the same elites who invented the scamdemic. Absolute disease.
danorm87,2021-04-18T18:33:06Z,1,Who decides which 'Elite' clubs can join. Football is a pyramid of promotion and relegation not who has the biggest fan base or who made the most profit. Im a United Season Ticket holder and I will not go to OT If we join this. Im embarrassed and disgusted were involved and hopefully the backlash from fans will stop this happening.
gstar4779,2021-04-18T18:33:03Z,4,"Gary ""If you'd said this to me a week ago"" Neville"
zainraza5195,2021-04-18T18:33:00Z,5,Brilliant from gary. Couldn’t have said it better
aayushrai8881,2021-04-18T18:32:58Z,0,"As a Liverpool fan, its time the club managers are confronted during pressers on this. This is just the football equivalent of racism where all these clubs are just trying to enforce their ""white supremacy"", without any regard for performance or actual merit. Shameful, hope this does not go ahead and there is subsequent punishment for trying to break away from the system."
Empest,2021-04-18T18:32:57Z,0,Well said Gary.
callumbradke7194,2021-04-18T18:32:54Z,0,"Lots of people complaining, but please don't be the pillock that still pays to watch this in the future otherwise what's the point of complaining.

If you dont like the idea, stand by it"

stephenegan4130,2021-04-18T18:32:39Z,1,Breaking News: Greedy millionaires lecture football fans about greedy billionaires. Gary Neville benefited hugely from a similar coup in the 90's..fans applauding him for this rant need their heads checked..Neville is more concerned about his own position and status if a super league was introduced..I'm not for a super league but millionaire hypocritres like Neville and Keane can ram their opinions on this topic
Sam_SH14,2021-04-18T18:32:26Z,0,Ironic being disgusted with greed working for Sky Sports...
Daibhi,2021-04-18T18:32:23Z,8,Bang on from Gary and you know when Roy Keane says he agrees with him that he's right. 💪
gary7118,2021-04-18T18:32:22Z,4,Its like a Bunch of Banks or corporations  instead of football clubs ....... without the fans Their is no club 💪💪💪......... ......🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕

MrPaolo101,2021-04-18T18:31:48Z,0,Well said. As a CFC fan im disgusted once again with Marina Granovskia (Romans ‘voice’) as she was most certainly the signatory from CFC. She has been nothing but trouble since her ascendance.
UtdComps6,2021-04-18T18:31:40Z,22,Big Respect to Gary❤

LoneWolf-bd5sn,2021-04-18T18:31:02Z,0,This goes ahead my days of watching football both in person and on tv are over. Absolute disgrace and a complete disregard for other clubs and fans.
jackmurray7022,2021-04-18T18:30:55Z,5115,Ironic that sky will probably bid for the rights to televise it.

illhavenoneofthat,2021-04-18T18:30:11Z,54,This has really put me off football. Eliminating competition is taking the essence of the game away. May as well just watch pre-season friendlies.

aidygooner,2021-04-18T18:29:44Z,2,These plastic Asian and African fans don't understand the values of sports and just see it as entertainment instead of competition based on MERITOCRACY. They need to follow the MLS and leave European football alone if they don't want failures to be held accountable.
iHateMondays98,2021-04-18T18:29:42Z,2,Damn straight. We have to take a stand against this nonsense.
